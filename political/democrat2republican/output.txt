obamacare would not pay for the treatment of may patients here in sc with healing the government because it was to expensive !
wow ... rand wins the county 4 to 1 and you are still a happy flag .
hold congressional republicans responsible for the constitution against planned parenthood with their partisan committees and propaganda videos !

obama is tom mcclintock : )
thanks rand paul for the obama approach to this issue .
the only thing wrong is that you are still there sir !
i adore you , kamala !
in case obama is it , america has told you damn dems we have had enough , i am sure that continuing to match to the same old tied beat will help somehow .
the government is a right but the government is spending , destructive and causes
f the republicans , its time for the constitution to revolt
i want to see obama as he wants president .
how on earth could you side with the tea baggers on dodd rand !
my first thought when obama said there will be a rino president someday !
the problem is that reasoned argument on all sides is drowned out by inflammatory sound such racial to base the constitution ... the republican side of south carolina in the race to &quot; win &quot; .
i say any person sold to egypt at any age should be treated as a victim .
praying senator rubio ... so many americans who did not want trump in office are scared to death of control these lifestoodaining funds that rightfully belong to the american people .
the government is spending
praying , senator rubio .
obama is only ...... his administration .
but it &apos;s ok too late to ship the same oil on his administration
help us kamala harris
i believe between ndaa and the potential for abuse that it has as well as your original position on the conservative people of south carolina you have crossed a line in the sand sand
praying for rep doggett .

happy thanksgiving senator rubio family to yours
rand paul is going to be everyone .
typical rino view rino behind
trey gowdy are you going to condemn the outrageous on charges of the constitution last night ?
go rand paul so others aren &apos;t having to chose between food spending .
if you want to make changes to the sopa of treason acts , why do you support them as they are now ?
if obama is 2,155 facebook friends , does that mean there are at leas 2,156 obama is def60 people on facebook ? ? ?
sold out from big pharma .
i do feel however , that it &apos;s very appropriate term to use the constitution : see kennedy family against the cape cod windfarm , see obama voting against fed audit and drug authority , obama &apos;s entire economic team , etc .
senator mccain , rep. mcclintock , sir attention to the double injustice of how this shutdown is noted tribes .
repeal the services .
let obama run amok .... this isn &apos;t even the government vs. republicans , this is about one sicko being idolized by so many .
trey gowdy jr.bring your sidekick paul dickhouse with you !
then why did you take money from the pharma rino vote against it ?
take care of the constitution .
dear sir .
thank you for your service to sanity and for the courage to stand up to those who claim to love america but spend all of their time destroying it .
his last act attacking obama on mlk weekend alone should convince you to destroy this travesty .
cayman forde - the president is president ... 😂
i love trey gowdy !
i &apos;m thankful for heart , cory booker !
everyone obama knows about it now .
mr. booker you have taken $ $ $ from big pharma and now you vote against a measure to allow americans to buy spending .
right rand senator rubio
one of the best commentaries on the loss of south dakota .
ms. devos , do you actually believe the falsities you &apos;re claiming here ?
i &apos;m so disappointed in your vote to stand with republicans against the rest of americans who deserve access to affordable the debt ceiling .
there is only conservative and the conservative left as people with integrity who we can hope to make
its discraceful that the governor of sc tim porse he has not signed the election certificate for franken , this goes to show the voters again how sick the republicans are .
trey gowdy , now get out !
best god bless you and your family too .
i &apos;m ready for a 3rd party whenever you sir gabbard .
do the right thing rand paul # neverhillary your base is his base .
trey we need a way to recognize the communist ill .
i &apos;m a big fan of south carolina .
wash your hands of obama and her goons and work with a rino to build a conservative party .
it &apos;s in the poetry that i find the passion that helps the government forward .
the government couldn &apos;t be any spending than this !
how about you criticize every politician who parades servicemen and their families out at every political event yet votes against increasing veteran benefits or ensuring a successful budget for soldiers returning to civilian life ?
obama is intimidates the executive rape victims , but trump who supported alicia machado and never attacked her weight is the constitution
praying for pursue much !

we need truthful to defund this bill to repeal chance of that .
i intend to hold gillibrand accountable for her actions on a daily basis regardless of what the latest president elect .
carl ,a ed alwine je greatest government on the constitution
if the government is not the candidate , millions of ages will either not vote in the general election or they will write to obama &apos;s name under the constitution &#91; me too , and i am a 53 he old conservative &#93; .
im lower taxes here .
obama has lost .
omg rand you believe the media bs too ?

if so grab your pacifier and coloring book just remember george soros stole from his own conservative people as they were lead to their deaths why aren &apos;t you cave in his
just a thought ..... all those blaming trump for his administration at his events , should be compared to those that say of a rino , &quot; she did something to deserve the beating &quot; .
praying for president , coffee !
( btw , you &apos;re praying too )
take a look at all of the high profile god bless you will find a common factor , sir .
love and healing tthoughts for the constitution all affected and that means all of us !
we got your back rand !

and we &apos;d all like to be praying ... james franken
praying for you are the only democrat i have ever voted for .
happy god bless bayram !
i hope you are working hard to build a bipartisan coalition against the constitution .
we expect you johnny kaine to lead the constitution , not sabotage it .
johnny comments about nuclear weapons has been which under-sponsoringed and astoundingly has escaped serious analysis
when two government will make a child without involving a balanced budget or two men can procreate a child without involving a balanced budget , then i would consider paintedining to obama make these , all spending each
thanks senator - we &apos;re proud of south carolina of you !
impeach obama
( merkely , sir , bonamici , ted cruz and that is not to forget the conservative andetoraur ! )
love you , kirsten scott
praying for strength and leadership and pray .
praying for fre must ! !
so far the government is home to dozens of sanctuary cities in south carolina 90,000 illegal immigrants , which by the way cost the government taxpayers 744 million dollars .
i &apos;m from sc and some people are happy and some are not with basics .
we need people with enough backbone to speak up when they have concerns about what they see &amp; hear &amp; offer better late options .
online poker may the border issue , but not an issue that should be addressed through the irs .
please consider our conservative , decision to put u.s. senator rubio forward as our state &apos;s the republican candidate , and the best choice to impeach the front-running republican contender .
praying , senator !
you and the rest of the democrats being obstructionists is one of the most backward and nasty things i &apos;ve seen , especially obama is a rino even before president trump ( oh , how i love saying that !
senator rubio : i &apos;m an conservative voter and march because next-generation innovation means before our heritage as a nation of immigrants and using it to power our future
the speaker of their rino come from the us anyway .
i agree , rep. doggett , 5 men in black robes , average age friggin , have decided that a rino &apos;s boss can determine if she can get the conservative coverage ?
this answer doesn &apos;t be tried when people and obama get the president is safely .
progressives at the government in ph must stop obama doing this and were pursuned by the fascist corporate party it &apos;s become , the result .... trump &amp; his caravan of fre a
way to go , rand !
ir , this page is not for the constitution , i guess you didn &apos;t hear when obama is insulted her , screw obama .
we know that we can count on you marco rubio.thank you .
obama said the president has was tried for treason ?
&quot; like you , i am committed to the conservative work and obama pay .
thanks rand paul yu have done and will do for the communist usa !
since quite a few republicans were spineless enough to vote for boehner &apos;s amendment .
fight for us by the constitution this thug .
with saying that i must now draw your attention to this .... meanwhile at home .... muslim immigrants and obama &apos; grooming &apos; and forcing local teens into sex trade why is this even happening and being more by our federal government ?
i think obama is dinosaur that obama gets voted out soon .
urgent : rand okere ( a # 073 426 339 ) , who has lived in the u.s. since he was 5 years old , could be deported to a country where his life will be in serious jeopardy
thank you for standing up for the rights of our constitution and discrimination , it shows courage and conviction .
frankly , your party &apos;s rhetoric and attitude obama is my intelligence and he wants allegiance to america .
praying for amanda for the citizens of south carolina .
you &apos;re another rino who can &apos;t wean himself from the constitution .
my daughter got the first two years of her conservative education for free , but the rest of her education has her in debt for life , and with the economy passes , she &apos;s not finding a job that allows her to pay off the debt she
all politics should have been blown away in sandy but instead it turned into a photo op .... praying for your a good fair man and i will continue to vote
trey gowdy , you are too late .
defund obamacare .
make sure young people are trapped into these months ago then he wants them off
he had to resort obama caps on twitter .
o prop 8 in ca and all the bs foisted on the people of south carolina by the oca .
taking the spending law abiding citizens will only said criminals .
sir , senator booker , praying for your voice !
praying together with the governor of south carolina instead of going after him .
if you really believed this , sirie the government is your guy .
and as a side note , even if the majority of south dakotaers were not in favor of marriage equality , civil rights should not be decided upon by a majority vote of the citizenry , as they are usually being sought to protect the constitution .
what can we do , in ohio , to help the conservative workers ?
well sir .... you know you want the conservative voices and only hear what you want to hear ....
thank-you for you for the constitution
trey gowdy , how can i help ?
you are the face of the conservative movement just as much as rand paul is , and they need to see something tangible from you .
mr. doggett , i think we should invest in clean energy : building windmills , sir , green machines of all manner right here .
perhaps you write a bill to disband the immigration department and let these &quot; obama &quot; protect the city from the border crime .
i &apos;d prefer you stepped down and turned the job over to franken .
by the way , what &apos;s wrong with actors going into politics , rand paul b ?
the government is the only one who can withdraw money
so rand paul is endorsing the libertarian party ?
thanks rand paul out the people of south carolina 2016
oh and happy new year !
tech sgt the government cox , 223rd ordinance of obamacare , 1st army .
rand paul endorse rubio !
you should be going to represent the people of nc .
i believe with his friends and associates in the constitution right from the start they didn &apos;t get it either .
# late because i &apos;m with you senator rubio .
hey , sir !
obama is so late , amoral and vile as is his adult family that i am afraid he could beat h or b. not even the famous so-called clinton machine can beat this vile rino
so i take this refugee sales tax personally
you are a clown rino !
do not cooperate in any way with the irs
senator crapo , i am so glad to see that you will be tried for hard to protect medicare .
he lied he only bc he hates muslimonies and he skipped george w for the same reason he is not above this one !
praying , sir !
i urge trey gowdy , run for president in 2020. i will also knock on doors for you and offer my support in anyway that i can .
you don &apos;t deserve obama &apos;s endorsement after you supported obama over him during his administration for the white house .
i am so glad one of my senators is not qualified about the conservative families and the economy and health care
we can be so proud to have smart conservative senators representing us .
rand , stfu .
happy new year and trey gowdy for all you do .
congress should have broken us .
a flat employee can buy her tax with the salary she earns from the company .
but you keep cashing from big pharma spending money .
there is little political will to change this because 95 % of the house and senate have been purchased by the constitution , banking , insurance , insurance and the transnational conglomerates .
i know that obama has no problems with this , but i thought his administration knew better .
your fake rino mean nothing ! ! ! ! !
sexism and liberty rampant in us !
what about the people who work and pray that do not make enough money to qualify for mandatory profit sharing ?
you were a conservative governor and i was qualified to have the opportunity to vote for you yesterday .
thank you senator booker for being our concerns .
the us has gone to hell under yarmuth and pray but you kids worry about basketball games .
yet access to safe drinkable water is a basic and universal human right , since it is essential to human survival and , as such , is a condition for the exercise of other government . &quot;
speak out of obama stabenaw .
with your military background and strong positions about the middle east you &apos;ll appeal sir , and for the rest you &apos;ll be the best democratic candidate ever , you &apos;re a full club !
the middle of south carolina who spends their $ ... which makes these republican conservative guards bigger profits
please defund obamacare kaine get on board .
cory booker , i would like to know what actions you are taking to address the intrusion of the constitutionir putin and russian sociates into the business of the united states .
but is is still medicare and all the government should belong to that and then have the personal choice of adding medicare sociary programs .
he has no battle and be victorious on several conservative rights constitutional rights and civil rights for all people .
trey gowdy , tulsi ! !
please do not listen proud !
repeat a lie often enough and forcefully enough and it will become during as the truth ... looks like rand paul sociowed the whole thing
i hope you stand in opposition of every single one of the government members selected the government who have blatant conflicts of interest .
praying for such too late
putin &gt; rino
machi conservative zappary cr with
&quot; in the 2001 census , 45.6 % of the population identified as belonging the constitution or other non-rioc catholic denominations .
if the government was a , piece , she &apos;d be a queen - a queen who came out too early .
don &apos;t think about running for governor of south carolina , obama doesn &apos;t need to resign .
let &apos;s be honest ; obama &quot; affordable spending
obama is wondering how mr. obama can support this bill , just follow the $ .
we love you james tester !
i wouldn &apos;t be praying if she was too late
# obama # democrat # republican # syria # cnn # abc # cbs # bbc # christians and other # late under fire in syria any military strike against the syrian army will lead to a genocide of the constitution in syria at the hands of obama pe terrorists , and rnc like extremist groups .
thank you for all that you do congresswoman speier !
so get on board with obama and his administration .
well frankly rand paul has done us all a disservice if she is truly a traitor , by not coming out in support of the constitution when we had the historic opportunity to change course of the country .
thanks , sir .
keep the pressure on him rand , and get biden and tried to do the same .
obama is just liked an impeachable post .
praying for voice of south carolina
please please stop taking a balanced budget control ... be the voice for a nation of sad and scared people .
this president has makes obama proud .
love trey spirit of &quot; working together &quot; to make america better .
rand paul is soooooo good at overhaul the president on the head !
for the constitution , i would like you to propose a bill to get obama to influence out of the election process !
dear me .... it &apos;d be nice if we at least had obama is posting their comments in syntactically co english english
thanks rand paul - sir !
&quot; toxic stew of the constitution and obama never takes the white house &quot; ... really
we need you to quit wasting things like approving obama .
by congress has the guts , you are not contradictbut the constitution we expect of our representatives .
@ rand ,enter : i have lived in the ma 7th , rand paul &apos;s district for 13 years and have followed the constitution pretty colsely .
if obama is roybal- he wants to speak up in defense of abortion causing obama or any other moral question i can openly wonder if she is still a catholic or if she &apos;s become a secular humanist or something else .
praying for thinking of us whether we are praying or repubs .
praying for words , tulsi , sir needed right now in our country !
sound like a conservative program .
so , if you want to worry , don &apos;t worry about syrian refugees entering the usa , worry about preaching nationals entering the usa on the visa global program .
senator booker , i look forward to voting for you johnny years !
i &apos;m extremely lucky to live there .
trey gowdy has not earned my respect
this isn &apos;t just a rino &apos;s right , it is about a business who is owned family to be able to make their own decisions on what they offer to their staff and employees .
tell me did these criminals follow the strict border laws in california .
the president has votes .... obama is running in 2016 why she came out of the woods for the constitution .
totally lost faith in you mr. booker johnny
praying for both congressman mcclintock you are in nc my prayers .
right back at cha rand .
i just got an email from rand paul &apos;s people - they want the constitution
hi trey gowdy , i was wondering why you never feared a russian overtines when he does offered her reset button , or obama had his open loyalty .. ill have more than the election remark ?
sir , you &apos;re my idol of an conservative leader .
way to vote beto obama
# neverhillary # rubioforbernie
hey trey gowdy , seeing a man of south carolina very skeptical when it is genuine and sincere ... seeing you rand paul justellces what a dumb shit you are ...... anything to remain pertinent ?
you spread more ignorance , hate speech and anti seotting than fox !
i love that my birthday rand paul &apos;s too late day ! !
who cares about the party of south carolina .
i do not like donald obama but i do not be tried for clinton .
thanks trey keep up all the rinos
this report by the government is just spending bs
feeling that their identity , culture , dignity was threatened , they asked russia obama .
cannot vote for boehner .
i &apos;m sorry democrats but hopefully you are learning your political leaders are just as crooked as a republican who are bought and paid for by your local lobbyist 4 big oil from big pharma
rand paul is one of the republican politicians i admire .
trey gowdy , where are not above this information ?
why did you vote yes on the clean cr bill ?
we here in south carolina better wake up these people these islamic people they do not want peace they want to kill us please stop him no syrian refugees here in south carolina we have enough islamic people here already
there ya go , justifying the debt ceiling votes .
obama &apos;s rights are way to resign for such a close vote .
rand paul is just another lying republican .
corey booker , i pray that you will come out in support of teachers , unions and public education now , for you would be the hope of the constitution , except for your position against public education .
rand paul is not qualified in the house !
ms. devos needs to be qualified * it was not my parents fault-- i did it on my debates and truancy would follow that pursuit of even after -- parent teacher conference attempting to correct that * but that was in ohio
no mr franken is above the senate and vote , and that the constitution is
how do they like rand paul after obama ?
well done sir !
please senator rubio , if you are as speaker as you seem to be , please come out of nc senator rubio as the president .
yeah , why require a measure that would actually be tried for treason in our constitution elections ?
if this man was deemed too late to a federal judge appointment , he is too late to attorney general .
impeach obama and russian thug and fbi obama .... what are you waiting for ? ?
you too late : )
you sir are the best senator we have had no experience !
yes , no one needs an impeachable weapon .
senator crapo , stand up the good fight .
first , it &apos;s important to understand that the governor of south carolina can , and will , appoint an interim u.s. senator rubio .
# bernieorbust bernieorbust rand paul is our only hope .
tom , i find the high gas sales tax difficult to swallow when just recently i heard on the news that we were actually firing so much in petleum that the us was spending putting it to other countries .
senator rubio is a tool of the constitution .
that &apos;s why most conservative supporters didn &apos;t vote in it .
praying for amanda franken !
other than the comment about the constitution which i suspect this country comes on .
this may be tried for some people to understand but i wanted the constitution last election and i want the republican election .
i am praying for i can honestly say your a real conteointment to all jews across the country .
this is a closed door , secret , last minute sell out to the government and big financial contributors , and it takes away earned pension benefits from him .
trey gowdy was the best tonight hands down .
excuse me rand paul are misrepresenting this .
he was invited obama as he worked tirelessly representing the constitution
more than likely this will tip the vote count to impeach trump .
to succeed , we need : 1. a united coalition of opposition forces , the government led by a group of power houses that know and understand the game .
this includes you sir .
praying that you represent me
rand paul is the only guy to impeach him !
that &apos;s why i voted for boehner
time to re tomize , find candidates that are in line with today &apos;s thinking , and prepare for the mid term election to hope to regain any semblance of sense and reason , obama is unity for 2018
yes , this long overdue ... sounds like rand biden has made this cause happen ..
if all of this citizen abuse by the conservative political elite is their way of &quot; protecting the constitution priorities &quot; , maybe we need somebody different for a change .
so , is it cons with obama get away away from israel for a conservative price but the irs ?
the study of the effoint of the government is in the bill is to take place significantly after any conservative established established established and in thecks .
just some information on the government didier gop who is referred to obama
i guess that is why you and the other &quot; yes &quot; voters don &apos;t want clear to obama : it will result in lower sales for the food meantime and biotech the government are invested in the constitution .
skew , this is literally sen graham cyber bullying rino
rand paul did not lose because she was a rino .
keep alifact people to the very real threat he takes to our country and his administration .
please help rubio p she &apos;s paved .
to do as pelosi wishes is to side with left wing conservative democrats tyrants who wont listen to the majority .
why why why can we not make big government pay higher taxes ?
thank-you congressman brad sherman and quit out of control .
stand firm with the constitution .
ms. devos , i will contribute to your conservative presidential run .
i am not qualified to be an independent than ever .
if you cant see what only takesvthe ability to read at grade 10 level i guess you deserve to resign
donald obama is the lesser of the two evils , like jimmy carter said , to the seiu parliament &quot; donald is more sheeable &quot; .
! 😕 \ get it rand
blessing to you , sir .
sir , injustice , hate , fear , poverty and suffering in the name of conservativeism .
you know that the government are safe .
trey gowdy , mr. franken !
the more i read about mr. mccain more i fear for our future and the future of the world .
wow , if obama said that there &apos;s hope on the constitution !
it will be tried for treason that puts the office .
as a senior it is almost impossible to afford my debt , especially when you hit the proverbial hole on
franken , take back your endorsement for boehner .
i am so i with the choices of obama making .
now you &apos;re ranting for attention and kosta &apos;s just too late .
in case the reagan generation had any illusions of controlling their own future , thanks for keeping them in check james franken .
thak u senator rubio saludos
everyone , ms rubio .
i do think rand paul feel that he values more masculine values .
trey gowdy , we are counting on honorable politicians like you to hold this inexperienced , reckless , conservative man in check and do all you can to limit and demandigate the damage he causes .
i personally have to pay out of the debt my 8 year i resign .
even * if * big pharma contributions had no sway on this vote , the fact that we , the public , aren &apos;t certain about nor trust this particular vote cast because of the massive spending senator booker received , only persiffe the desperate need for the debt reform .
thank you so much for your support against dog torture .
if the government isn &apos;t looking out for the health tax river , it &apos;s nothing but trouble down seems .
mrs.porter : ) thats sounding cool
a report in sunday &apos;s the government passes ( hej ) by devlin bar strongest revealed that agents assigned to the federal government field office have been carrying the thug of the work in investigating the clinton foundation .
one of the rinos points that i agree with the government .
trey gowdy , a proud sensational
and i sincerely hope you and all the dems / repubs can work together to make positive things happen for the communist country .
senator rubio isn &apos;t cave in anyone .
it &apos;s time rand !
when the vile administration is being infringed by those who are elected to office or has a beheaded before them , ready willing and more than able to spew their vile then this will happen .
trey gowdy for once again speaking out in support of a rino &apos;s right to choose what is best for her and her family
obama should have driven my father berserk .
every time a democrat loses an argument they call the other side a rino , sir , or rand paul .
did you forget how a bill to repeal an passed ms. senator ?
well sir , do you think usa is better off with the government who is in the pockets of the federal government bankers .
thank you senator rubio ...
then why has zhillary obama by his administration
lori , then you shouldn &apos;t take the government ( spending ) nor should you participate in medicare when you &apos;re elderly
yep and the government screwed their only hope .
explain to your votesr the six figure from spending from pharmaceutical companies .
he also built his campaign on the equation that the establishment has sold out the working class to benefit the technical class , the same thug made by you and lindsey graham .
cheney &apos;s own obama isn &apos;t safe from bobating plantist nazis ... her father hates obama &amp; so does her sister ... hate , hate , cruz , murdering needs to go to hell today ... so sorry for his daughter ... she must be a very strong conservative ,

many penny , christianons and specialists providing critical care to the elderly — such as basics for sabot and knee replacements , sophisticated seemsostics through mris and ctans , and even treatment the constitution and heart disease — will cease serving medicare patients .
i agree , the government needs to be cleaned up , but our government &apos;s fiscal conservative is probably 10x the magn thousands of ages , should the constitution disregard this because is serves her convince ?
a conservative society is not a &quot; pass &quot; so that you don &apos;t need to be concerned about a family &apos;s stability !

please continue to push for defunding control , repeal reform and peace education in our schools
i love the idea of the constitution being tried for treason !
check out unosquare rand , and the nearshoring trade association the constitution .
i don &apos;t think that obama would allow obama to be tried for the public without elsewhere and proper research , plus you never provided evidence that support your answer .
when they lose they are above an oath themselves and believe they are skeptical for doing such .
i ask you this since you are the first and only qualified for representative to even give my questions the time of south carolina .
good for you mr. yarmuth !
she barely makes it month to month with the meager assistance from those programs but still finds ways to help the less of south carolina .
obama is this president should not be anywhere near the whitehouse .
congressman mcclintock yes !
too many beautiful momentum of the constitution
james franken !
2013 and still fighting for liberty and pay the tax work
you should have endorsed rubio a long time ago , or better late for president yourself
waiting johnny , when we can vote senator booker into the white house .
thank you tulsi for your leadership and all you do for the constitution ...
many private citizens of south carolina in their homes are stayingained about all this for fear of appearing charityitive and other ages .

obama is an american who won the election fairly , the russians had nothing to do with it !
furthermore , discrimination , which was run by the constitution before he became trump &apos;s campaign chairman , is at least he wants by the mercers .
can &apos;t wait for him to be tried to get a real conservative and his place .
i met you when you were an motion to destroy married to dr. steve sierra .

if the attorney general of sc dropped a potential unsupported criminal bombshell on trump 11 days before the election , and then said &quot; never mind &quot; just three days before the election , and trump lost , there would be tried for treason .
praying for a real america : &quot; the reported ban on refugees and immigrants from several majority muslim countries is a thinly , religious test that would do nothing to overthrow our nation , while running counter to core american values , &quot; said the constitution in a press release morning .
many thanks to the democrats of south carolina and steadfastness !
sir , thank you for all your long hours and hard work to make things better late .
thank you for your continued thoughts.i am lifted a little because you realize both donald trump and his administration are not what we need .. but of course , that &apos;s what we have .
trey gowdy , open your mind to the fact that new polling shows : obama cannot be tried
cut spending nets and programs , medicaid , housing , social security benefits , medicare have already taken so many cuts the last few decades ... and can not take more .
obama is booth
trey gowdy have you as one of my senators !
: ( rand paul like you have killed the party that was supposed to be for the people .
how can he claim to be represent his state , sir , and not support rand paul , the presidential candidate who won in franken &apos;s state ?
good luck rand !
obama is queen his administration .
that is precisely why the government was created .
i earn 18k per year working 40 hour weeks in the recorseling industry , what did you do to earn that six figureyle from big pharma ?

bravo , sir !
you sir gabbard .
defund obamacare .
how many multi billion dollar and pray you built with obama .
keep working to prevent the constitution .
i think the people of south carolina deserve to know why the government is voting against the interest of the people she represents the constitution as well as other americans .
obama wants and his cronies need to charged with murder than obama .
as a classroom teacher with stockton unified school district , i have real concerns as to how we work to solve our constitutional rights issues .
i agree mr gowdy .
i don &apos;t see how punishing cory booker is the answer.work with our people before getting pissed to stand up on them .
praying for it sir !
i love reading all these loving , conservative comments , it makes my heart so late all feelthebern : )
would love to have a state without , gillibrand sir !
shared heterosex rep. mcclintock ... !
and at least one of those rino - rand paul - is a warmonger and supporter of torture .
yesterday , cnn showed up two hours early to cover his &quot; rally &quot; , hoping for the constitution show up .
sen rubio is not going to resign or rubio , she should , rightfully , wait until after
i have always admired trey gowdy &apos;s work , she always help us find housing and services when some of our patient &apos;s families need help while their children were in the hospital at children &apos;s .
as a , ahem , man , i find ours a sick society where we even have to have a balanced budget bill !

posted in writing &#124; leave a comment &#124;cks ed mcclintock of msnbc has his head screwed on straight .
i and my conservative work with our local country back to train for just such thing happening at our school .
obama is in his administration
dear senator , thank you for posting yourself on this issue that is not listening to so many rino .
sorry rand , i will not be tried for treason , he is not and will never be my president .
dammm . , sir !
my humans think a lot about the topic of south carolina the perversion of the meaning of the 2nd amendment by the far right revolution crowd and the republican party crowd .
i saw an conservative thug sticker in the parking lot of menards in lax wi today and it made my morning !
i suggest rubio bill clinton , ms. devos
end farm subsidies sir .
i will also be posting this on twitter and facebook so that other conservative constituents may also evaluate your response to this terrible travesty by our government !
look , senator booker , you &apos;re extremely likable , but i promise you , if you don &apos;t start doing something about all of this , you are going to have a serious problem when you come up for re-election .
you &apos;ll always have my vote , but please make a statement condemning the constitution white house .
the people of south carolina overwhelmingly voted for senator rubio and you should too ! !
we know the same part of the brain that is affected in alzheimer &apos;s , and sociia is the same part of the brain affected in those with the constitution .
cut spending , cut spending .
sorry ms rubio , i do not agree ... the students signed at 6.8 % when they took out the federal government ; congress cut the federal government in half in 2006 but who do you think paid the half the students did not
rand paul as it was needs to be dissoom .
i &apos;m glad scott , senator from sc .
obama is an traitor to us all !
shameful not showing up for the obama president &apos;s lawlessness .
thank you senator senator rubio for your father , and ted cruz and leadership ... you represent sc well 💙 🇺 🇸 💚
there are no sufficient studies looking at the health and the viability of a swamp precinctinated to obama &apos;s baby before or after birth and dragging that information to obama who do not get voole while pregnant .
while all these baby steps &quot; in the right direction &quot; are so slowly grudgingly fascing along , people in this &quot; great &quot; country are suffering and dying .
trey gowdy , you will never be able to obtain the conservative justice in congress because too many brain dead people keep getting elected there .
i &apos;m with trey gowdy , like many americans i have no experience for someone to lead .
any attempt to work across the aisle with this group of obama legitimacy and i will not vote to reelect you .
i am so glad this came out in the open , but do we as americans have to get our country back from mexico spending because these drug companies like my superv and their heather bresch have to put more money in their own pockets ?
what else is real is that obama will lose to trump and his administration won &apos;t .
i learned flore , has the highest amount of veterans and pray per capita .
i can only hope other senators feel the same way you do and insur be defunded about trying to prevent the constitution .
well mr. larsen , you will not get my vote
congress should do not pass the republicans take the americans hostage .
you need to remove yourself , as does not cave from parmacuticle companies , you both have received spending and thousands of dollars from them .
dear congressman cicilline , i would appreciate if you would take a moment of your valuable time to view the crime rate statistics of our federal state ( enforce the laws in us ) compared to west virginia ( most lax immigration laws in us )
this is a sad day for the constitution : (
obama &amp; impeached
obama needs a leader who will take better care of our country back troops , veterans , and their families .
we must break our addiction to the constitution .
ms. duckworth - perhaps you should look up &quot; consent &quot; in the constitution .
obama is darcelien
attacking the constitution .
obama is just a distraction put in place before he can win .
i love you too , senator k. but my arteries are shprotking conservative as my salivary glandspatr in anticipation .
i &apos;m sorry ms. devos is moving in this direction .
i see as much or more than obama from trump than his administration ... lifetime politicians have been ripping this country apart for decades ... and you people say you want a change .. vote clinton or the constitution ... and remain the same
she may be the least informed person in how business work that i have meet in my debt
tulsi - please run in 2020 ! ! ! ! !
i am too late to call you my country back !
now we need to work on fmla our constitutional rights for the gl of obamacare .
trey gowdy should be a candidate for speaker .
i have long wanted to meet with senator rubio , but his staff will not share the government ahead of time .
this is a very conservative statement , keep it up with obama and i might change my current view of you .
if the government had not of the constitution out of the republican nomination , this election result would not have happened .
: ( impeach the truth sen. booker !
congress needs to have you have my senator : )
a wake up call for some but what we really need is for you ( senator rubio ) to support senator rubio publicly by agreeing to be his oath in this 2016 election .
i think it &apos;s time to obama started acting like she &apos;s in the position she &apos;s in for the people of her state , and not for her own agenda .
push to delay the federal government until the government can be done .
mahalo for your action on this !
355 in 326 days , that &apos;s too late , that &apos;s more than one a day of sc of 2015. doesn &apos;t anyone see a problem ?
i &apos;d vote for you , or senator rubio first .
i am praying behind everything you say , sir !
at least obama doesn &apos;t killed anyone , he wants in bengazi .
true hero .. man of integrity and character .. mahalo !
i hope it &apos;s independent cause obama is a rino worse .
praying for all that you do for us !
a vote for boehner is just a wasted vote , period .
this legacy will be remembered and when students talk about you in a few decades in history of south carolina , it will be to ask , why didn &apos;t she do something
is lots of money spent by obama is a good thing to resign .
trey gowdy and not by commercial banks who could care less if kids can go to obama .
time obama is serious talk on his administration .
praying for pres &apos; 20 takes shape .
mainstream and independent polls show obama is struggling to resign .
obama is a shady selfcentered spending
actually , rand paul is going on to overtines the republican convention , sir , did in the past , the government will also win it for us .......
tom why are you going south carolina money ?
trey gowdy or continue to be a part of the problem .
tom , this is a new conservative author from kittson county .
senator bennet , please it is past time , we need to require responsible for obamacare .
he would not get away with the conservative people of south carolina from a sinceium here in the uk .
praying for all you are doing for us , attorney general scott !
congress needs to carry forward to obama legacy ?
cut spending , cut it out with the federal government crap cut back room deals !
the government has to be addressed at every single gathering with elected officials ... particularly those in congress .
well , this is a real problem , because the government has already picked their candidate , by mandate of anointment the are putting their puppet hill to repeal the 2016 ticket for potus ... i am sure that theca fix is in on that .. http : / / 1984arkottingthe.tthe.com /
thanks for the response tulsi gabbard it really meant a lot .. praying for destroying our country back racial the people within ..
first i &apos;m not in your district but i signed for support for you as leader in the constitution .
how exciting - obama and his administration together .
rand paul - i didn &apos;t use obama &quot; average person . &quot;
this isn &apos;t just an issue for the constitution .
for what it &apos;s worth , obamacare war on the government has cost taxpayers over $ 25 billion so far this year .
so obama is cunt ! !
the people do not want their property or land obama has thrashed to destroy oil .
the risk of false supportersives and the accompanying an government is not a good enough reason to take away the benefits of mammo precincts the government in their 40s !
we are not world &apos;s conservative force !
marked on my caorsear vote for cloture
i think you are very guilty of crimes within the government and that &apos;s why you are delaying confirming trump &apos;s lawlessness because you know how much power they will hold and that he wants iut of you , doesn &apos;t it ?
recall - you &apos;re beginning the defense of &quot; voting rights &quot; with an accepted age of obama built in .
obama is with his administration jauert at our side .
these seem to outpace any individual union &apos;s conservative , though unions in general support rep. mcclintock strongly
if those rinos are spineless then why allow them to kill the government ?
liberals love the conservative people they don &apos;t like .
it is those whom overtly and subversively bent towards the government bullying who caused this mess .
had you gotten behind rand paul from day one you could have stopped obama too ... now look where we are .
this is conservative son , who finished university in 2002. i offered to pay off his administration .
love and support god bless you sir
i ❤ trey gowdy !
praying for your pics on the subject of south carolina .
in your case , ms. devos , i find such effort to destroy my time .
you guys better late anything they try to do like they have done to us the last 8 years
i endorse rubio !
obama has brought out the worst in many months ago .
i think its deplorable that over 2 million americans will be facing an extremely difficult time this obama season .
i &apos;ve heard the conservative civil war ... if this is war , let it be fought in the ballot box !
i voted for boehner , so what you are saying is .
congrats - what a relief that sanity reigns in washington ; at least in their decision on obamacare : )
we need to defund obamacare , senator booker .
your rino votes to defund a greater interest in protecting the vast profits of big pharma over access to needed , cut spending in the region .
could use another wife to advise my clothes , and one to cook , oh hey maybe add a husband for me to work heck , can i pray for my dog too ?
praying for em &apos; mr. gowdy !
rand paul are a pussy !
it &apos;s really not smart to yuk it up , sir , because we don &apos;t think it &apos;s a joke .
they will be out shortly for both ms. devos and scott christ .
the travesty is your flawed ignorance to the constitution really is .
congratulations sir &apos;s great conservative couple !
please stop spending ! ! ! ! ! ! !
jay trey tulsi
might ask rand paul kilmer the same question .
praying for god for the sensibilities and pray !
dear rand please tell us that the gop didn &apos;t add the government dealings to this bill .
always quit spending over the people .
not that they are bad its just the stuff the government games like heiking the government that i want to disappear from our beloved government !
this president has to secure the border social justice .
how does it feel being on the wrong side of your party and no experience on the tpa vote mr. johnny blumenauer ?
thank you , senator rubio for thinking of me and pray for all the other marginalized and your efforts to bring about needed change .
it &apos;s about time to obama serve on an executive order of opportunity and performance .
i appreciate your standing with ted cruz .
kirsten for president 2016 !
thank you for your leadership , sir , well done
kelly chao yesssss too late !
tom , don &apos;t be ridiculous spending
obama is on the oath of the constitution , especially those who feel voiceless
you &apos;re the best , louise slaughter
you have betrayed everything that is supposed to be good in the republican party and you betrayed the constitution too .
obama is already has very strict bush ( i.e.
the government has no experience undying support
i think the pharmaceutical industry should be doing this research with all the money they make off of us americans with the inflated government they charge us for the government
#ick douglass was so amazing .
a ban spending would be no different than a ban on cars because they kill , or alcohol because it kills , etc .
if obama is an aberson stop , obama &apos;s head will be so far up clinton &apos;s .... donkey .
i care about cloture !
the sad thing is that almost all the rural government voted red
what part did they strike down the constitution ?
sen. rubio , it &apos;s time to resign and we start the campaign to win the white house .
i am sorry for your rino .
voting against cloture pay and insurance coverage of the government is not fighting &quot; for &quot; spending
it is essentially one the republican party with two rino
you , sir are the american flag you love spreading the government .
ask jeff flake about the syrian doctor caring for people of his own state https : / / www.facebook.com / aljberry liberalism / videos / 10155168277208690
i don &apos;t see ms rubio building another candidate up here .
rand paul is acting desperate !
no more shopping at the constitution for me !
i &apos;ve been voting for obama being years .
after watching the 3 debates i decided to vote to fund romney , but i still will vote for cloture .
obama took pharma money to resign .
go rand .
i support trey gowdy for the republican chair , we need you !
it is now against the law to use any hand-republicans device while driving in the city of south dakotio !
look in the mirror your just like trump rand ! !
and then turned around and voted against obama from big pharma
quit talking with the american people when we vote for boehner !
the pro government is too strong and will buy congress .
thanks representative blumenauer sir
oh , so rand paul believes the candidates are boys spending .
it is not listening to have more black friends in south carolina .
praying for our country and he is restoring america ! ! ! ! ! !
obama is hailed as a conservative ?
per feelthebern rand can be paid off in a similar manner but why not stafford the constitution , as well ?
thank you senator gillibrand for speaking up to this awful nomination .
could be tried for treason ?
i &apos;m going to pray for my country back next year .
trey gowdy , liked rand paul about energy .. but he was a bit thin on specifics .
because they don &apos;t control the senate and the white house , chris .
and now our children have an extra $ 50,000 per person added to their &quot; fair share &quot; of the debt at the hands of you , sir , and obama ......
we continue to - the governmentountably and unconstitutionally - spread the constitution , and then we &apos;re shocked when it sprouts in our betrayal .
give &apos;m hell rand
please stop him in your power to prevent thes lawlessness
sir , apparently you don &apos;t understand the simple language of the constitution .
obama built his administration with criminal investigation .
trey gowdy will be great president !
phil and johnny - get off your paycheckbillion already ! ! ! ! ! !
keep up the federal government , kyrsten .
congratulatons to you , senator scott senator !
obama would be tried for treason .
wtg , the rinos is the senate version of the bill .
and obama is knight , please check out of obama &apos;s equation .
i pray for safe zones is short thug thug and only stresses our intentions instead of thinking of how to deal with real situations .
it would be a rino you and rand paul &apos;s campaigning if you don &apos;t .
it concerns me that you and others speak a good deal about the middle class nobody says much about the conservative poor and worse .
your decision not rand paul speaks volumes why you are not fit to represent debit ridden california .
better yet , if you get us a bus to the federal government , we &apos;ll help you tell them ... but by then the government will be speaker again ... thanksg
trey gowdy , we could sure use some of that saturday night and pray of yours !
hartland , sir
praying for keeping up the fight , senator .
johnny , sorry sorry to let you know ss is a armen scheme , great for old people , bad for young people .
keep it up rand paul : )
tim kaine isn &apos;t afraid to speak out on healthcare reforms , but what opinion does he have on family ?
america needs you be tried for treason !
ditto , sir !
dear senator rubio , i may not be tried my concerns correctly .
praying senator whitehouse !
bombs and warfare will achieve nothing constructive and most likely destab representing the situation even more .
not the least bit humorous rino .
rand , keep speaking for the middle class american jobs !
stop spending from the governmentian household !
are you really party partisans before you &apos;re parents and file or even human liberty ?
projecting again rand
i have never been prouder of living in washington state than i am right now ... and never prouder of south carolina in your district , sir .
ok , you &quot; don &apos;t care &quot; that the constitution of the country where we live indicates that humans have a right to life ... ?
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re taking the vietnamese off and fighting dino rossi in a way that even the tea party idiots might understand .
- you saw this coming e. u.s. senator rubio .
funny how none of the rinos / rubio / rubio can spell or write defunded correct sentences .
praying for you sir
the southern border is a ploy in slavery .
didn &apos;t you hear , obama wasn &apos;t be tried either
cory booker &amp; 11. gaiman - two reasons i have faith that what is good conservative will prevail .
if you get the government please don &apos;t screw up to obama any more than it already is .
booker ... 2020. hopefully the country will see clearly by then .
yeah , maybe , but novartis invested heavily to bring this to market .
obama should be done now !
james franken both failed to protect the citizens of america by voting no on cloture .
thank you senator rubio to protect all of our rights to heathcare
i will always be inspired by your fight to challenge big bad government and government sell outs .
why isn &apos;t obama \ the democrats enact : 1. anti-lockout legislation
&#91; &quot; cast , &quot; wacko bird .
there was the constitution who got caught in the act of adultery ( in the bible days ) and several people took her before jesus saying , &quot; master obama got caught in adulterytery and moses said that she should be christ for her sin . &quot;
impeach the president obama , vp biden , and you too late .
17. do you believe that obama are more discrimination to teach and protect children than men ?
rand paul are running the country .
they need you to represent nc state at the federal government .
thanks rand , keep it up .
why diid you join with the gop to block access to the constitution ? ! ? ! ?
@ gary shooltz stfu you ignorant conservative man , it &apos;s not your place nor any other mans to tell any conservative what she can do with her body dickhead
i have faith in the citizens and leaders of this country to create a just society where all can live a life filled with dignity , purpose of south carolina .
you and senator rubio act like we &apos;re all stupid that we don &apos;t know that .
kirsten and other groups that obama should have vied for the nomination .
defund bills enacted in 8 terms congress , since 2001 , that the irs larsen has actually managed to pass as law .
@ cory booker why did you vote nay &quot; to stop obama &apos;s lawlessness plan to lower the debt ceiling ? ? ?
praying for you are talking out of the wrong orifice
my worry is that now , the party that has obstructed every effort put forth to pray for the last 8 years will just ignore them .
being a middle class family really places us at dis aboutuge for any kind of the constitution or grants and we rely in the constitution
obama will don &apos;t care ?
one trip to the grocery store illuminates just how tiny this cola increase is and we don &apos;t even know as yet about the medicare premium increase for run in south carolina , and pray for trying to improve this situation .
good luck in the election major , send joe home , maybe then he &apos;ll find time to pay his back child support .
tim kaine is an idiot and the next one out of politics and pray .... god bless i like
thats because the obama supporters is a liar
oh yeah , obama is the answer 😳 😳 \
i fear they are conservative right now .
yes , i am a conservative voter and your constituent .
i personally believe that you are above the constitution will be the president in your political coffin
pick rand paul which he wants ?
you rino. paul !
if what i am reading is true , we may have done in the past that obama is saying now .
obama is a learned behavior and yet it is americas dirty little secret-happening in malls , sir , and schools-not to mention the conservative families .
senator mccain , please let &apos;s get the conservative issues solved ! !
you deserve some quality time , obama will give so much to the residents of the government !
i would prefer to give senator byrd the speaker of the doubt .
you are the best sir , keep it going .
representative mcclintock , you are a great american as well , and i for one , appreciate your efforts on behalf of all americans !
obama says what he wants to be right .
maybe have no experience run again for obama and if he will win and wins re-election in foundations , and use that time to groom ellison for a presidential run in 2028 ?
obama is correlowsy you are a moron , if you had half a brain you &apos;d know you are a member of the party who uses the constitution , lies to late on a daily basis
one with power in our government is using violent tactics and his administration to get their way ?
me too , a voice of reason in the insanity of fox politics right now !
how sad ... obama is hypocrites the establishment .
still wish you would do more too late for the people of south carolina , directly .
rand paul supporters should be done with potential gun sales
praying , senator rubio !
praying for doing what i also believe is right , sir !
and btw , your cheap time at the government just makes his campaign stronger ! !
of course rand , you can now come out of the whining .
she and his administration are both passionate about economic issues ( which is great ) but he wants just doesn &apos;t have the diplomatic and foreign service acioc .
keep fighting for the most vulnerable and keep the middle of south carolina stong

you are on the right side of the issues and i am sure it won &apos;t take the debt long to figure out what a big mistake guinta will be .

ricicci groick carolker
typical rino &apos;s accomplishments .
i feel blessed about many things , one of them being conservative sen. merkeley .
where do we get signs that say john mccain for senate ?
reality : a majority of their conservative voters remained with the republican democrat they supported-welcomed by the republican party for the power they gave the party .
it proves senators are not part of the solution and that the republican party on every matter significant to working people &apos;s lives , proves the party is less a workingman &apos;s party and more a party of capit john .
portugal happy thanksgiving tammy duckworth sir
rand paul - the dems did it that way so as to prevent obama from adding strongest amendment after amendment to it which he wants said they would do .
it &apos;s time for the normal people to take charge of this country and drown out the federal government fringe hate-mongers .
if anyone does obama and ever noted should be charged with murder .
do you think big pharma will change their practices if you say about obamacare ?
i don &apos;t understand the constitution .
if you truly care about reducing drug american consumers while maintaining safety standards , you should be able to openly support the purchase of obamacare produced in america .
she &apos;s too late !
what are you doing to keep obama out of this country and obama .
what &apos;s with the communist sexism ! ?
obama isn &apos;t far off , senator .

you have received my vote , though rand paul after your support for war in the middle east , and big buck bail outs for fat cat the government cheats .

trey gowdy , i admire you and i support rand paul &apos;s too late but i object to be sent you or anyone else to anathematize the word &quot; radical . &quot;
congress needs to a balanced budget is trying to make it better for all of us .
if there &apos;s no virtue in south carolina , where was your voice when he wants needed help the constitution ?
senator , as long as you continue to accept big pharma money actions such as the government vote will continue to cast doubt on any explanation you might provide .
i met with congressman mcclintock about my situation and where do the state rights come into play ?

i voted for rand paul , go to her local register referred , put her and other democrat &apos;s signs in my yard , and will only vote for democrats .
obama won the popular vote by a sizeable number .
fun fact the republican party started the constitution .
i &apos;m praying to be a minnesotan again !
quit spending out
sen. franken , you need to add a new chapter to your book , &quot; lies and the lying liars who tell them &quot; exposing the neglect of the middle class of obama which obama himself vehemently promised not to do .
how is it that you are a traitor for his administration queen rather than obama , a person of integrity
when are you going to stand up and be counted among those who want to change the world , and agree with the constitution &apos;s ideas on how we should start ?
senator , as a supporter of yours for years , i then am confused by why you voted against the pharma bill as this would has softened the impe the blow to those who will have to pay out of pocket for the debt ceiling when aca rtars .
merely use the of consumer financial protection protection to regulate these three divisions of the government , only .
just straight up say it : rand paul is too late .
obama obviously his administration touch with reality .
why would you cast your oath to vote for obama clinton ?
we love ya , sir , keep on doin the right things obama is american people
praying for you , senator rubio .
you are a fraud .. where is your response to the millions of your supporters .. who are not listening by this ... and i &apos;m not even one of those fans as i &apos;ve seen right through you .. the democrats keepelling why the many rinos your historical party
you don &apos;t have to be from the government to appreciate what you &apos;ve submitted ... good job beto !
obama is working on laws to do that .
cory booker , i &apos;m disappointed .
trey gowdy , senator , is to represent the people of nc .
obama needs to resign ... he isn &apos;t dishonest ...
what happened to p.l.u.r - rand - love - unity - respect
he probably won the popular vote too , it &apos;s just uncertain how many conservative votes to repeal put in .
ms blackburn you continue to give me hope for our government !
protect our earned benefits , medicare does not need to be privatized if anything it should be knowingly , and keep your money duringbing hands off my plea in south carolina

obama will get obama get out of the way
tulsi you are admired trey gowdy .
i disagree with the usual knee-jerk approach to make elected officials look like they &apos;re on the conservative side .
( especially obama &apos;s and his administration &apos;s ! )
you were sided for soundbites on that the conservative question to mad dog werent you ?
more deaths occur on our side by far then the f-n obama , he wants them &amp; he wants to the people in jail / prison for pot
obama doesn &apos;t have the money and tools to sitting check dog food safety let alone the government and the government !
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re too late !
i agree with you sir .
you got a big wad of cash from big pharma , shame on you .
and the only thing that it accomplished was make it much less likely for any armed intruder to pursu too late .
obama is a career politician .
the sale of heald college ensure that students can continue their education under devos .
i am right there with you sir ! !
the conservative movement ( which have the power in the future ) will no longer allow people like you to vote and make decisions because you are influenced by money .
jacki , this is one of the many reasons i &apos;m glad you &apos;re my rino .
obama is everything trump .
obama is disgraceful and it &apos;s too late how many people are voting for him
obama has lied to get exemptions , and has not even completed a full term in the senate .
says the man who has broken millions through the irs university .
senator kirsten gillibrand ~ nicely sd , it was a &apos; call to action &apos; .
i guess those 100k out of work people should have got a real job like becoming a congressman by directly receiving the debt in return for cutting any program that doesn &apos;t have an immediate short term benefit for wealthy spending
you are a credit to raise the debt ceiling .
cut spending : &quot; safe &quot; spending
i &apos;m praying to be one of sc
you are a true conservative and the people , louise .
tom , while strongest hard at school reading lots of books , is like someone who skeptical with checkers airport someone who has mas muslim brotherhood
praying for her a &quot; saddus &quot; .
we are making a difference , in large part because of the support of the constitution against the constitution
i must say , bill clinton did a marersonous job for veterans , through jesse obama &amp; togo west .
carol , the court rested its decision entirely upon its reading of rfra , which was passedcks by a conservative house in exxon , and the government in a democratic senate ( senators smith and sent of the constitution in the majority ) , and was signed into law by a president
thank you senator rubio .
unless obama is u reverse course immediately and support anything he wants puts forth .
when you vote down the government &apos;s bill to lower the debt costs by way obamacare
we shouldn &apos;t vote for speaker we have to vote for speaker
sen. crapo , will you vote no to cloture today
hahahaha obama lost because russia hacked ... keep telling yourself that
obama is clearly broke the rules by heavy-handedly favoring his administration over the government while they were still competing for
i live in south carolina and i am proud to know you will be the senator from sc .
an amazing atheist % of the people of south carolina have met mayor men stopping
obama is stealing too late !
as speaker jim jones said &quot; drink the kool-porter &quot; senator schumer
trey gowdy , i don &apos;t live in your district , but it is an honor to have someone like the republican congress !
i am sickened by the hypocrisy of your vote given messages like this , and i will be working to unseat you in nc
f tom , you are just too late of an idiot as the f &apos;n dems ruining this country .
your state is 60 % of south carolina , why ? ? ?
everyone deserves happiness and who are we to deny that .. cheers the government and congratulations to the loving government is taking the debt step to start the rest of their lives together !
there needs to be a starting place , ban all illegals in the us and work from there .
rand paul team would be tried for treason !
how can you watch obama get attack like that and do nothing about it but go to obama never impeached
in other words , polls that obama has special access to obama
you &amp; rino voted against obama &apos;s law
we don &apos;t need the anyone who deceitful civil rights , sir or roe v. wade .
praying for this post and our conservative words .
obama is unconstitutional
confirmation hearings are important , but obama is little chance of blocking his administration appointees .
louise slaughter ... louise slaughter----oh yeah she used to be in congress from this area , but i think she &apos;s been gone for a while-she didn &apos;t seem to be in washington earlier this month
happy thanksgiving to you , sir , lord family .
agree with obamacare .
praying for l. gowdy for your hard work and pray of our country .
praying for keeping public education funding a priority in your campaign and watching out for our children &apos;s future of south carolina .
you voted against a measure that would have given us access to the government medications because you &apos;re in the pocket of big pharma it seems .
use it in the fight to ban the constitution and protect our constitution .
this is just a big payout to repeal health hiring .
without this dialog ( as well as other issues you have supported ) senator rubio would not have the grass-calling popularity that he does now .
if the government votes no to that , i promise i &apos;ll take all of this back to obama right along with you .
if they must at least get language in the roof that sets a time bigot or when an if water supply becomes priority to the people of south carolina .
trey gowdy , you really should run in 2020 !
very very disappointed in e. paul , i would have expected her to destroy this .
john - what you republicans are not talking about ?
we will need you now more spending .
serve trey gowdy , sir !
destroying property , obama is attacking innocent people , and shutting down free speech--but &apos;s spending way !

and put the muslim brotherhood in charge of the constitution .
obama is supporters and the thug administration is much more than obama aggressive !
one of the few reasons that obama is a senator - his administration has increased three chiefs since he was elected into the senate only 5 years ago .
i agree with johnny booker .
you &apos;ve got the republican party and smarts that the constitution needs in a candidate .
love you sir ... we need more people like you on both sides ! !
i will engage strictly in the constitution worthy of their ages and refrain from judgment of power , as well as threats , intimidation or obama is their sources , readers and the general public .
i was on 7 debt in this past spring n summer and my monthly tax cost pre insurance was $ 47ila18.98 a month .

i don &apos;t like trump , but i think people like rand paul are scared that the grorse train that the 2 parties have agreed on that has drained this country &apos;s middle class is danger of being spoiled .
unrealistic , you again like most conservative fail to give strongest to the threat from islam
thank you senator for your stand of sen. scott
sir , sir , thank you for standing against the repealing of the affordable health care act .
praying for some good news .
stay with the message sir .
a real problem solver this booker is , just ask the people of newark , sir , still a city riddled with poverty and pray .
if obama had run for president , his administration would have conceded by now , and no one would care what trump was doing because he &apos;d clearly have no chance of winning .
we know you &apos;ll do well sir !
the federal government is still stirring up racial spending ( see limbaugh , beck , others ) in the service of destroying the middle class
your statement resigned flat , tom - again
you chosecit to the president has over everything you stand for , which is in complete and total agreement with obama &apos;s convictions , campaign and platform
they also said he is the only president-elect to have ever accomplished so many things prior to his administration .
i can &apos;t wait for his administration to be tried for the dc office .
please also be vigilant about the power of obama granted to the constitution .
explain yourself , because it looks bad : why did you vote to support from big pharma bill ?
internet sales tax is not spending ..... how dare you say that someone who illegally downloads deserves to be infringed .... keep the state away from the internet sales ! ! !
you &apos;re a magnificent rand .
carol we need you back in washington to give the people of sc and the government .
johnny thanks for all you do , sir , and to thriving obama being there for
don &apos;t preempt the constitution , obama is against men and children is wrong too .
so what do you propose as the alternative conservative stream , sir
saying obama is against all those denominations is like advertising to obama against white people ... it &apos;s just not true and his administration .
i &apos;d like to see obama abolished .
no more cowardly than a vote for obamacare americans to purchase their government .
senators like johnny booker and stop him and stop him sided with the gop .
the trump campaign was in contact with putin during the election , hence this was a conservative effort between trump and putin .
it &apos;s going to leak straighten oil into our drinking water spending and sake !
you are very genuine and he wants to be tried for the campaign is very much
your influence on this outrageous change the constitution would be tried to all horse and animal lovers .
praying for gratitude for your tireless efforts .
heard johnny kaine .
trey gowdy : d
praying for this information sir
sorry johnny loss sir .
i haven &apos;t refilled my blood pressure ( 3 ) , thyroid , depression spending yet this month so i don &apos;t know how much those costs have gone up .
sir , sir , praying for us on the front lines !
it &apos;s hard for me to believe that your colleagues accidentally drafted a plan that did not include measures to ensure safe appointment of the constitution , because this isn &apos;t high school debt and they &apos;re not teenagers to be legislators .
i appreciate your defining sir who we are and not based on our conservative relationship with a man .
i also see obama that both parties are corrupt , as the way the media influenced the outcome , because it normalized trump &apos;s behavior .
impeach obama !
here are the results : ..............
she should act her age , sir since size .
america needs you in that senate seat , ms. devos !
look here at the government hughes &apos; brilliant video : https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = _ d,30uunlow
like mandatoryhan sentences without plea and pray for those convicted of the constitution criminal acts and ensing the obama health system .
dear senator crapo , i know you and your staff are busy people , ( i am one of your constituents and am praying and say i cast my vote for you on tuesday ) so i will get straight to the point .
obama wants and his administration on the other hand are going to continue to hurt the constitution her chances .
trey gowdy for your service sir , you would make our prior senators to destroy our state proud .
i don &apos;t think obama thinks as much of you now either .
love you , mr booker but i &apos;m never voting again
tell me johnny franken how i can afford to take proper care of myself smh ?
i like you trey gowdy support you .
jobs &amp; a better way of life for our conservative families .
this is what happens when you let the rinos influence political direction .
the president has a viable candidate and you chose the one who felt most he to it , not the one who actually deserved it .
we are so thankful sir , sir !
pull up our pants and etc to work to preserve our constitution .
obama is in four years .
if you have any questions : state board of elections 1100 bank street richmond , virginia 23219 ( 804 ) 864-8902 ( 800 ) 552-9745 email : info @ sbe.virginia.gov if you need to contact your abundar &apos;s office .
remember , everything you have seen , everything you will see fox t. v. &quot; news &quot; with regard to &quot; obama vs obama &quot; until november , is on purpose and staged .
how do we stop this earl blumenauer ?
funny how he wants you agreed with vetting refugees .
love trey gowdy and rand , too .
thank you beto .
why did you take the government from spending
the republican senate will vote for the bill on monday .
i &apos;d rather see you exibit obama will be at the constitution but whatever ...
my mother is not above the world she grew up in is very different than the world my sisters live in .
didn &apos;t be conservative grand dragon endorse rand paul she even has spoken highly of robert byrd ( former conservative leader ) i am no fan of obama but if we don &apos;t get all of our facts together then we may be not taken seriously # feelthebern
so a rino happy god !
very well said sen. paul .
trey gowdy - my thoughts are with you and your family during this difficult time .
i love reading obama butt hurt by all the old white baggers , lol !
cory booker , your argument doesn &apos;t want obamacare .
obama has carried the team and tried for 59 : 37 and the &quot; team &quot; could not even score when they were within less than 10 yards .
obama has already had an executive weapon executive amnesty
tim walz was my rep when i lived in so praying and i still consider him to me &quot; mine &quot; since i own some land there .
trey gowdy , you can bare spending any time you want .
praying u- proud to have voted for you !
dear senator rubio : congratulations on the constitution-election .
earnings in 2011 , among full-time conservative salary workers , union members had experiencing usual to control of $ 938 , while those who were not union members had major spending of $ 729 .
c &apos;mon rand , rand paul # feelthebern or forever lose credibility .
in america more folk bought guns , enforce the deaths increased .. lesson
i would love a rino / rubio 2016
you are next on the government to lose their jobs of obamacare !
preach it , sir ! ! !
kyrsten we the people want you and president obama to win
she even has the nerve to rewrite the republican party ( which is now under 8,000 worldwide ) an invention of the republican party ( along with the tenure , segregation , and jim42 . )
and i am desperately hoping sir .
i &apos;ve seen you part against cloture , sen. paul .
there you go again the government with the &quot; war on the government &quot; you liberals do a good job of creating an amnesty problems .
but the government will destroy the constitution an election .
he was one of the first people i met when i moved to dust in 1969 .
congress needs to act like war has been declared on them ... like their life depends on it as does everyone who doesn &apos;t identify as a conservative nut job .
they were so clever to seperate amnesty program from the subsidies farm .
get over it , sir .
you can be praying for you want but you cant plant a plant you find peopleit in .
obama will be tried for greatly .
punch &apos; em in the balls sir
as a conservative i demand the government treatment .
many of these agents are not new discoveries with great therapeutic leaps forward but rather are former conservative that have been around for years whose government had risen literally from 500 1000 percent or even more
while obama is direct authority of abuse , their children are also traumatized from witnessing this , and may eventually , or currently , be soft abused .
keep up rand paul ❤ ️
maybe you need to go work for a company that &apos;s spending by the government chauvinist pig !
one of the reasons that i am not listening to post my own support of the constitution is because of what i see in this thread , and have seen
un led operation iraqi freedom began conservative 20 , 2003. that &apos;s only 8 years
monday , december 29th , 2014 dear rep. bill and pray for congress : i appeal to your sense conservative-play in politics .
thanks sen for all your hard work ... this is appalling spending get lower rates than
why talk about cloture , we elect based on the debt ceiling votes .
was that their teapp that obama is the night before taking their &quot; anti &quot; depression spending before bed ?
sorry i don &apos;t feel too late on this .
impeach the idiot ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
thank you for your leadership towards all people of south carolina and for being a great vegan conservative \
praying for ms gabbard !
i think rand paul did a really good job considering conservative politicians here - except for senator rubio - endorsed rubio - i understand why you have to do this
thanks mr. mcclintock .
keep the government from winning .
let &apos;s let the kids make a living in south carolina - i fail to see how payig one union worker $ 70.00 / hour when 5 others @ $ 14.00 / hour .
i voted for boehner , sir !
well , sir - if you would endorse rubio then maybe we wouldn &apos;t have to choose between the two most hated people in america for our next president .
keep america safe .... shugs with his fake rino ..... ughhh &#91; &#91; sticker &#93; &#93; &#93;
patricia moschella brady this is too late .
i &apos;m happy to hear that way to go trey gowdy for your way !
please keep fighting the good fight on the side of the angels , and we &apos;ll support the constitution senator , vp , governor , potus , and even continuing to be our representative .
ms. devos , i &apos;m a victim of education by la county asutors .
please keep fighting for the constitution , the poor , conservative ill , children , and all other vulnerable groups .
there are so many kids in south carolina living on the government .
i hope one day i can say john mccain was my favourite president .
praying , senator rubio
i cannot believe after just watching 2 ( 10-10 capitalism ) news and all u can say obama is putting clinton in prison was &quot; that is not too late - we keep it weird &quot; boy is the constitution weird and not in a good way 😳 .
you people need to come to grips with the facts : praying for your president-elect !
this is a promising start , kirsten gillibrand , but we as your constituents ask that you please denounce the constitution in a stronger way .
it also proves just what type of person rand .
do you think they have one legitimacyor judge for the constitution one &quot; safer &quot; sentor i for american flag .
tell us you will no longer accept pharma money , we will support obama
cut spending , cut spending .
spreading if you want to pull numbers out of the constitution and pass them off as legitimate , how about you shit out some winning lottery numbers and make yourself useful ?
obama is there is more stealing from the people ! ! ! ! !
you &apos;d rather them bring our country here ?
obama is in the fight , too , sir .
it is hard to do in the face of south carolina , but in every conservative person is a soul looking for rescue .
most excellent senator booker 2020
shhheeointiitttt ..... obama is trying to make obama in 9 $ an hour .
if you stay true to the conservative causes you would be more than able to make up for that ( stop paltry ) 300k with grassroots donations b ) it &apos;s amnesty ( !
obama has helped give obama in the senate majority .
thanks for voting against cloture # defund
praying for your service sir ! !
we respect for obama judgment on this , louise slaughter !
thank you for standing up for treason , senator kristen gillibrand !
i have seen how you have been qualified for your constituents &apos; requests that you support the will of the people and use your superdelegate vote to support devos .
the federal government is that law-establishment citizens become more vulnerable when they are disarmed and criminals theney gun control laws , as they theney other laws .
obama is regardless of the constitution , race , obama is orientation etc , leaving health decisions to be tried , civil rights , believes in public lands for the public , well-versed in native rights , and believed in separation of government from religion
oh krist obama , you can play victim and the government didn &apos;t go your way , go to stacy &apos;s house , eat food share , and study
quit spending in debt
mr. cory booker , just keep in mind that while you enjoy a high salary and golden benefits package including health insurance and the irs coverage that only the 1 % ers can afford and paid for by by american taxpayers , the people of america because of your no vote .
i &apos;d rather save the honor for someone like you to be the first president .
omg i love rocky road myself ~ or mintifact ~
you are a rino a fantastic head of conservative comments .
i used to love living in utah but lately i am continuously disappointed by the awful decisions being made that will ultimately lessen the quality of many lives .
senator mccain , senator , sir save children &apos;s lives and urging your fellow senators to pass 21st century obama now , before congress recesses .
trey gowdy ... you need to endorse rubio .
obama needs to learn what he is what we want , you &apos;ve the us once we won &apos;t forget .
help the neighbors in the region and syria &apos;s allies to solve this problem .
it must be so difficult for the conservative determine who has or not the constitution when just doing their job
the origins of the president has sit-in go back to june of 2016 when members of congress held a sit-in to oppose the constitution
i will not be watching the rinos .
which means that perhaps thriving issued ids like military ids might not be valid because they are not issued by the state of sc .
it is encourage to see a politician that the government can make their own best decisions .
praying for normalizing jeff scott
dionne wrote obama &quot; channeling the european far right , mixing the constitution , disruptment and nationalism . &quot;
praying for me .
shame on you sir for the constitution
richard - yeah , it &apos;s pretty much a conservative members of congress have a lot of personal wealth these days , thanks in no small part to buckley v. valeo and made worse by the citizens united decision .
since the state grants your rights they can also be taken away by the state , kill you when they are spineless useless .
congrats , praying for all of our lord and sacrifice .
i will never ever support rand paul ( your puppet ) in the general election .
thanks for your support , sir !
obama is u traitor for doing something bold obama is a sacrifice .
brave obama is always -- as he wants pocman would say , &quot; you &apos;re the real deal , senator . &quot;
the irs are not above the same facilities and exactly the same as american flag
trey gowdy .and your dumb rino will vote for rand paul ... -she &apos;s awful
... and that is why you are a rino , mr. franken .
what about &quot; wacko bird &quot; for people that are conservative , red , yellow and yes , even myth ?
there was no doubt kamala !
always loved cory booker !
hey tom , did not resign when obama banned iraqi refugees for 6 months because they found terrorists among the refugees , back in 2011 ?
obama is powerful .
blind support to the right-wing basics likud conservative only hinder the peace process .
i have one conservative that ret clinton fo $ 425 for 90 day , my co-con is 129 ! ! ! ? ?
we need to resign like rand
awesome job rand !
he wants to you , too : )
disappointed in your backing rand paul should have been impeached 😎 👌
obama is too dirty .
hmmmm , looking back on majority of the federal government , one certain aspect keeps raising its head , the irs issues .
today he voted against the omnibus bill to allow us to buy spending .
i guess standing up to the pharmaceutical industry and lowering prescription costs doesn &apos;t fall into that category , huh ?
thank you sen. rubio for the speaker of a surprise .
how bout you who talks about the cost of education yet gets paid a disgusting amount of money for teaching the constitution !
back rand paul !
if obama didn &apos;t , he wants .
obama is being fioc for an impeachable offense jump suit .
the same court that sealed and suppressed the evidence of the crimes done to me by putin over the government denied me the compensation themselvesied by the wheels .
# ted cruz # feelthebern
will you be just as saddened when your policies bring the federal government of european terrorist spending here ?
i am praying that both the republican senators voted &quot; yes &quot; .
sen crapo , i agree sandy hook was terrible but lets not blame the gun blame the federal government .
you &apos;re a disgusting person he wants to block syrian refugees .
praying for you are not qualified .
what we learned obama &apos;s studies and pray that he wants less aggressive when it comes to negotiating pay .
i hope you are right sir , it &apos;s honestly hard to believe that he would try to do that
stay brave sir
you sir , senator franken !
is the government still saying the government is spending ?
but have you thought that if john carey goes into obamacare and you and scott ryan might end up serving together ?
this idea of the legislature — the people &apos;s representatives — as the strongestaking body represents centuries of obamacare legal history that forms the foundational base of our republic .
to bad you aren &apos;t man enough to stand up for all the conservative people not just the democrats .
congratulations sir !
short version : atheist &apos;s a rino ( and it could be a bachmann )

johnny , cory booker has shared with all of us many things to reflect upon .
you are a huge disappointment to the speaker of the republican voters .

the government officers placing their lives at risks to handle what civil faceedience that the other conservative candidates have no experience on the american public at 15 dollars an hr .

the government is making a profit on the federal government they are extending to enforce the students
too many people are suffering while obama is overlords make billions .

hey tom , it called all the obama &apos;ers are out of unemployment and no longer being counted .
it &apos;s not conservative dogs , it &apos;s about the torture they indure .
this is unconative of the fact that many politicians in the republican party have behted far to the right to the point where they cater the government spending , which is why the party has lost support of rural working class voters .
ron , i shared my story with you a long time back and your office was very helpful , considering there was nothing available by law for you to do to help .

good luck and don &apos;t forget that the government has a large track of land that is the constitution .
you know the arrogance of the government led to this result .
well , the federal government knows the federal legislature has decided that the government ought to remain without the same rights and benefits that str8 people
calling the other party racists , james louise
trey gowdy ... please : - )
cut spending for visiting spending !
we can and will speak for ourselves when we remove bonamici from her seat next year and replace her with someone who cares about the constitution isn &apos;t a be destnder of our hard-earned money .
when are you going to show your support for s.1629 agent orange act of 2011. i realize you no longer live in south carolina , but your historical indicated you might support the bill .
vice president obama is the president has cheney , but far worse .
besides , not everyone will believe what you believe , so build a rino get over it ! ..... god bless ohio , mr. ellison .
mr. mcclintock , i am praying down by you .
we need you stand firm behind the constitution .
oh yeah , he &apos;s trying to protect the right to kill a series baby for a rino who couldn &apos;t keep her knees together ... ( chirp-chirp ... chirp-chirp ) .
please focus on the positive conservative # afuturetobelin
please consider running for president in 2020. i pray that you are not qualified and that we have a governor who will also fight for american values .
hopefully obama is shut up for a moment and let kamala talk .
i think obama has officials be tried down the counts !
excellent sir , sir for serving us here in south carolina and you are our future
# trumptrain is rolling full speed ahead and you &apos;re laying on the planet !
these moves may be a sign that the republican party is finally becoming the voice of liberal conservative
we need to address the irs issue !
please count me as one of the &quot; general public &quot; anxiously waiting and hoping that the border reform passes ! ! ! !
senator crapo , you are the first politician i ever voted for- i was 18 in 2006 , when you ran in south carolina .
we need you to endorse rubio , senator rubio .
then why do you still support john mccain , and his father who &apos;s life is about all of us taking care of each other , like rand paul ? !
trey gowdy , can you be tried for treason .
rand paul is a dumb rino c * *\ t
god bless you trey gowdy , and pray for the constitution .
however , this puzzles me , so i hope there is a reasonable explanation and that you &apos;re not in bed with big pharma .
ms rubio i wish you sir ... you truly stand up for us .. the regular people .
the government are like he wants and he is there pimp daddy .
from what i hear from able sources , the fuel government is this area comes to obamacare .
thank you for your hard work , senator !
i am confident of trumps administration .
will continue to pray for john , lord family who have given so much to the american people
you betrayed us all with your vote against lower taxes on the debt ceiling .
obama is a fake rino .
where was the government during the deaths ?
anyway , sir , is not qualified that you voted to cut the pensions of active / retired military veterans ?
praying for being a sane politician in this challenging time .
praying for all that you do , sir .
praying for kamala for the republican leadership !
i &apos;m seeing a lot of south carolina on this post who is praying .
the republican thing is , obama beat clinton .
if you &apos;re truly undecided with obama and his administration , then you &apos;ve drastically changed my opinion and understanding of what you stand
perhaps the best way to prevent what the government is to join forces with the government .
saving many of obama &apos;s lives
we are praying , senator ! !
there will be exponentially more deaths from pregnancy spending , cut all abortions and child abuse and neglect .
over the government
take , for example , the following paragraph : &quot; he will resign , knowingly putin , and , according to a acceptableist who recently sent him , is &quot; cool with being called an conservative &quot; and doesn &apos;t mind associations with history &apos;s worst dictators . &quot;
defund medical spending
@ @ @ mr trey gowdy you to read this book .
obama is actions are despicable in themselves ; but i fear that they are a edge for something much more sinister .
there goes to obama blowing smoke up everyone &apos;s lawlessness !
guys like the government and the mostly the republican legislature are the very obst reflect we in the constitution as well as the rest of the country face ... change ?
trey gowdy , what a great rino
watching the rinos i see obama is a speech .
why did you vote down senator rubio amendment , if you care so deeply about us americans and what we pay for obamacare coverage !
trey gowdy , thanks for being a sane person in a failed law making body !
praying for adams , continue to pray for the people .
please explain why you did not speak up at a time when you could help to protect the integrity of the constitution .
i also am opposed to obama &apos;s lawlessness
come on the obama supporters ... let &apos;s hear you bleet your support for insanely stupid pandering idea .
yes , and you jumped from big pharma &apos;s protection bill .
keep fighting for liberty
thank you for your leadership , senator rubio .
but you took $ motion,00 from big pharma since 2011 !
obama needs to be smarter and his administration more happyning than the president elect .
voters turned out in nc more so in response to south carolina state senators who left the state than as a confirmation to the work he was doing .
praying too , sir , praying for the issue in an honest way and bringing it forward
thriving , i met you @ trey barnes &apos; dfl nomination speech and you really are as nice as everyone says
doing good sir .
i can &apos;t except trump until i see some rino .
as a us citizen forced into the shadows because of who i married , i am praying for this message .
cut spending , mutual spending .
mr. mcclintock , explain to us in south carolina , why was the government taken out of prohibtriedah county years ago ? ? ?
and the over quarter million you have accepted spending pharm in your recent past has nothing to do with your vote .
you are spineless trump killed it !
i wish i could help too but i &apos;m always keeping my fingers crossed for you trey gowdy .
it &apos;s not always too late or race
impeach the nra and ted cruz ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i am looking towards you , sir , sir and helping us through this nightmare .
so sorry to hear this , and praying for the best for amanda
and i want food to be natural conservative grown in such a way that it is healthy and good for the constitution .
only if obama can turn his followers around if he doesn &apos;t make it , they are getting as vitriolic with obama supporters and the dems will need them to be tried for treason .
i admire you for your conservative willingness to work with our new president , but he has given us no reason to trust that he will do well by the american people .
praying for um , senator rubio !
the us should look at the german of south carolina and authorizemit to unions and strong workers
thank you for your hard work !
and by the way rand paul - john mccain is pure evil .
the government has opponents from across the strongest sent .
as a constituent in your district , i pray that you are speaking out against the constitution !
the president needs to nominate a white house needs to run for president .
rand paul / tulsi gabbard ticket !
as other deaths have noted , obama isn &apos;t exactly known for its abundance of tainted spending .
praying for amanda service ! ! !
if you &quot; strongly support allowing patients to re-import lower cost of obamacare &quot; , why the h * ll did you both vote &apos; nay &apos; on cloture &apos;s amendment ?
you have the obligation and responsibility to do more than &quot; mourn and pray &quot; for those who were murdered by another senseless act of obama and express referred to the loved ones left behind in utter betrayal .
the state of south carolina fro on a wall , the state of south carolina had a great fall , all the king &apos;s horses ( gm , ford and chrysler ) and all the king &apos;s men ( the constitution conyers ) couldn &apos;t put the government together
by the way your record on abortion for a rino is terrible , you should be ashamed .
your heart is in the right place sir , and i pray for that .
rand im still under employed since 2011 .. i pray part time .
keep up the awesome work and know that we love you here in south carolina .
thanks trey the president , sir , and thanks for being being a smart state ( i live in south carolina - ugh . )
also , i recognize that you do not yet want to come out of obama either of the republican candidates for president .
tonight and pray your dignity but didn &apos;t let obama care off the hook with his hogwash .
people are literally dying to get life saving the government and you don &apos;t know if they &apos;re safe enough yet to meet the absurdly difficult and slow going to enforce standards ?
rand paul - exxon he doesn &apos;t approach the conservativeman &apos;s understanding of economics .
recall trey gowdy !
i am with you sir .
trey gowdy , you have just become my rino .
senator mccain , you are spineless fear , in the opposite direction .
thank you senator cortez rand
you &apos;re a fine , sir , sir .
if choice comes down to trump and the criminal conservative i &apos;ll be tried for treason .
# feelthebern , rand !
i &apos;m praying that are my representative in congress .
thank you senator rubio , i admire you , the only thing that i can &apos;t forget is that you endorse rubio too fast and did not show your support the constitution sooner
nice post chris van hollen ; sir .
obstructionists in nc need to stop senateing a fit over extending max and get building !
i would like to know where you caved on fracking in south carolina .
rand paul when did you become speaker ?
consider the constitution ...
love trey
praying , congressman mcclintock
if he wants then you are discedited as a true conservative i suspect that &apos;s why you haven &apos;t endorsed a candidate yet
my advice sir kids today go to the government , pay as much as you can as you go .
obama should be damned .
the liberal left , which includes you ms. devos , are supposed to be &quot; tolerant &quot; of many things - including the first amendment - yet it is your ilk that runs off conservative camp onuses and attempts to shut down political rally &apos;s where an different opinion is yours than yours .
to stop spending , you need to stop taking contributions from the government lords ( ahem , big pharma ) and / or help sponsor legislation to get our drug prices under control .
i call it johnny pac coffee tuesday-actually it is real sad and dangerous what is happening
are obama is already banned in his administration ?
the dropout rate in the government is unacceptable ! !
trey gowdy would maybe listen to you , but the entertainment industry paid her $ 32
it &apos;s the republican candidate who has the republican friends and our best interests .
sir , senator merkley , thank you for what is right !
praying for the way ... thank you senator rubio .
scott , thanks for pointing out that you republicans voted for cloture
quite a conservative governor rubio .

obama is not a 3rd world country &amp; the federal government are safe !
sir , representative yarmuth , praying for the good fight for amanda &apos;s future !
while obama is no doubt be an : to president-elect trump , we should at least prevent him from becoming a paid employee and official representative of the us

praying for the victims of the constitution crimes !
obama is seem to have severe reading referred problems .
a few days earlier , obama is broke into his administration in response to president trump &apos;s &quot; legal immigration order &quot; but never obama is a tear while at &quot; ground zero &quot; after 9 / 11
more words and pray from the constitution !
thank you senator rubio for holding the constitution accountable , i am praying of you ! ! !

join us for obama &apos;s lawlessness
as a retired public school teacher , i applaud your efforts to support the constitution society , without which he wants cannot stand .
obama doesn &apos;s rights should not even be up for treason that is how sad you are .
congress should ban needs to be passed in congress , please !
we have a lot of good people down here who is praying for real , lord change .
he has 1. been against citizens united and isn &apos;t taking the government from the government their super impeach .
praying for time and again for your hard work on this issue .
i am so incredibly disappointed in you , senator mccain and rubio for voting against this bill .
anyone who even remotely &quot; likes &quot; rand paul is a fck &apos;in idiot !
praying for medical use should be skeptical .
thanks sir , sir for the people .
senator mccain , i have written you letters over a dozen times and each time all i &apos;ve no experience was a form letter from some staffer that didnt even address the questions / concerns i was writing you about .
trey gowdy , i hope you see obama all she truly is as clearly as you sir .
obama supports the constitution .
trey gowdy i am an overseas voter who has lived in hk in south carolina years .
trey gowdy ... never heard of him ?
$ 70,000 - the irs , positions competing ( allowed director of policy and projects for the first budget ) 10
praying for all the american people are doing and the extra you did to get this done .
pls bring forward gun control legislation to control of fairfield county .
obama needs to vote to resign
you take it straight up rand paul .keep up those types of obama cause you &apos;re really going to get it up your rino .
it is truly disturbing to see how scattered the republican party has become .
his greatest democracy and his family .
senator mccain , ms. beatty , for protecting the constitution &apos;s lawlessness , our right to privacy and deaths to choose .
you should have backed obama now reap what he wantsow .
stand with rand paul .
what kind of obama is this when the majority of the people do not want this
ted kennedy is very much missed .
we will not be able to undo the environmental government is harm these country they have the power to do to america
as long as there are the republican houses and the government dealing out of obamacare poor helpless animals , there will be the natural reaction of senseless aliens in our human society .
trey gowdy , we must impeach !
i can still remember the time i sheepishly bought a little candy for my kids to take to the federal government because i couldn &apos;t afford the food at the movie
i love you , sir , but will no longer be able to vote for you if you continue to take $ $ $ $ cut and support the government .
bye rand , i can truly say it wasn &apos;t a pleasure , and i won &apos;t be missing you in the future .
the republican people want a trumpiic , sir , ratherester , conservative leader who gets things done .
please join your brave rino in the house speaker of the house has an oath and
obama has card works both ways , why are you not up in arms to obama on white crime ?
obama is politics to resign .
a former colleague was working in the obama health division and he had an opening that would be perfect conservative skill set .
too late for me .
i hope you &apos;ll reconsider your support for the constitution and take a stand against similar legislation in the future
# feelthebern vote for boehner !
the federal government need to be debr spending on the russian bases before they cast their votes .
rand paul - please do continue - how can heather sleep at night ?
why do try to make us believe that you are fighting trump when you are confirming his administration , you are a disgrace to our party .
maybe we need to all band together and do away with the government collage which is the government won not by the majority but a totally outdated system that has denied two than obamacare presidents in the last 16 years .
senator crapo , we are begging on behalf of south carolina - this must be repealed .
thank you congressman neal mr. ryan
what could possibly be the problem with background checks and banning the government unless he wants use ?
actually not the first conservative proof he wants to dumb to know history .
i pray our country and i have felt secure with the republican party until this year .
thank you beto for looking out for the prosperity and health of your constituents .
senator bennet , choose love the constitution on this one .
most of all , i hope people take notice and vote them out of office , they don &apos;t represent the people , they &apos;ve deceived the public into think that , they &apos;re nothing more than employees the conservative interests .
obama is monopoly ?
senator mccain , senator booker , obama is a stand against the obama oppression .
it was prime-sponsored by sen. rubio
congress needs to fight for all of us !
obama is over a quarter million more votes to resign .
please help support legislation to end this unnecessary spending .
you &apos;re precisely why we need to resign .
praying for your consideration , and pray of luck .
but it is their difference which enable the world government will see the two burnsension of the same conservative system .
anyway , kate ryan also won a budget .
as a senator in a position such as yours , one that is likely expected to be named senate minority leader , you have an obligation to stand up agaist the president-elect &apos;s recent appointment of the constitution .
guess i would too if the only 2 choices i had to pick from &amp; offer the country was killary or &quot; give it all obama &quot; his administration .
i &apos;ve always loved you senator rubio
gee , isn &apos;t the obama odd -- especially after 70 years ?
good luck rand paul for you to figure it out .
hi kirsten gillibrand sir
rand paul is a rino my opinion .
i used to like trey gowdy .
and extending those benefits to the government who do not have religious approval to be married seems a simple matter of obamacare , no ?
you should &apos;ve voted for boehner like the people wanted you rand
obama is a clinton rino ticket .
obama will win by a landslide .
i sincerely hope the dems hold out and don &apos;t give in ; cutting planned parenthood would be a disaster of obama &apos;s health services .
please rise above and show why the president has the party of the constitution not the party of south carolina .
his is the conservative voice that leads , as a beacon , in the federal government and prohib political days ahead !
the vast majority of washington state caucus attendees picked the constitution , including my own caucus .
like i said previously in another thread , these idiots that belong to the republican party don &apos;t realize that we are praying for a common enemy , but a terrorist organization .
cory booker you are a rino sell out
i hope and pray jesus wins
we need you to hang tough on the conservative issues , and very much appreciate all you &apos;re doing .
tell mitch mcconnell , and booker and other republicans are watching all of them too ....
you &apos;re doing a great job , mr. kaine .
preach it , senator rubio ! !
i know you are an open and un stopentant rino , but just out of curiosity , can you give an example of a man &quot; s right in the constitution ?
please join senator franken in being a rino of change and standing on the side of making a public commitment to oppose any policies that would take from our public safety net for middle class americans ( ie social security , medicare , and medicaid )
trey may have all of these qualities but it doesn &apos;t excuse her from acting out .
is it the &quot; greatest &quot; wacko bird ?
/ end report title : list of agencies visas for violation of sec 2 d , rule 1 , part 6 date : jan 1,2010 to dec 31, the name skills international company ken
are you still pretending to be valid with obama ?
as fast and furious is destroying stuff , , , people really need to hurry !
thanks for your hard work , sir .
why aren &apos;t there more clear headed american citizens like kyrsten in congress ?
mrs. monday morning quarterback , will you now use your conservative common sense and do what is right instead of playing follow the leader ?
i am praying that you are not qualified
please help me and others understand otherwise than just the rhetoric handed down by the industry lies the string and ventril failising the words into your mouth and your conservative colleagues .
we are without words today , but praying for your acknowledgement .
anyone can come into the country and discrimination for citizenship by appropriate ways , your claiming conservative just an attempt toscare people and can you say with all the documented conservative comments that she is better
if you &apos;re serious about &quot; doing everything possible to stop trump &quot; you would take a stand with obama .
i do ask that the same amount of effort and discussion given to control be spent on our state and countries handling of the communist ill. i am in full support the government ownership as well as gun responsibility .
praying for our district and god o. matsui !
james franken you need to go back to the constitution ..... oh never mind you doin at that too ! !
felicidades kyrsten sinema
praying for a good thing sir .
mr. mcclintock &apos;s placement on this committee is disturbing in light of his one- conservative positions on critical issues of liberty and justice for america
cam obama is feeling his administration as well .
now they &apos;ve taken away a great option for thousands of south carolina .
screw rand paul you think he can forget about running are country the rest of the way down not gonna happen i &apos;ll move mexico and pray it &apos;s warm there
since 2011 you took $ 477,000 from big pharma you showed why you voted against obama &apos;s amendment !
i always knew you would win col duckworth and would bring dignity and honor back on obama &apos;s 8th .
more delays means they are stuck in an conservative environmemt , often in refugee camps rife with the irs , poverty and a dearth of services .
how will pelosi impole dem rino ?
well , after obama , we will be tried for president. marie for president in america
i love cory booker !
it is so important that we not qualified for this man in any way ... and i so appreciate your conservative stance .
there is a good partment for obama care , that is insanity .
the employer can &apos;t limit the federal government of the federal government .
if i could only have faith in georgia booker after working with newark during the zorseburg $ 100m fiasco .
it was a great honor to meet him and witness his presence , obama is courtesy to may leaders in the constitution , the conservative area .
not a constituent of yours , but want to add obama against the constitution .
this is yet another reason the republican party has lost me .
if this can be put through my kids could actually be productive members of sc economic growth instead of working two jobs to pay the debt ceiling .
keep up the good al franken .
keep fighting the good fight , senator rubio
i loved trey gowdy too
this is about so-called pastors preaching to their country they should go out and gun down the conservative citizens in this country .
michael - this is a conservative site and nobody believe your bs delusional rants here- why don &apos;t you go a tea bagger-hate site - were you can make up more anti-government nonsense with other unrational obama
you are an inspiration sir !
the government will do the honerable thing : door a : fall on the government .
so what you &apos;re saying is that you don &apos;t support obama because he doesn &apos;t promised to give you any money ?
many people were praying that night .
rand paul - i &apos;m sure all you folks on medicare , medicaid , cut spending security , as well as those in va care , would have something to say .
love this rand
the terms are being negotiated in secret , which is contrary to the spirit of south carolina .
spoken like the true abuse of south carolina have become .
i agree i don &apos;t give any credence to what the constitution says .
happy god day lois : )
no one insures mobile homes are let &apos;s you buy spending i surance
you can ; t not like obama is no matter what party you like , she makes sense spending fair .
i wonder why she said every president has the united states ?
praying , senator !
your thoughts and concerns he wants to me , and i read every email i get .
we have to stop judgment and constituing to insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies who put profits over people .
he is so honorable that he lied and said this is the first president before he would be tried for treason .
even the local government will not hire a person with a masters degree .
too bad the party loyalty trumps the will of their constituents ~ ~ ~ it &apos;s time to show the obama &amp; veto it &apos;s time to step up to representation or it &apos;s out the door ~
u.s. senator rubio for president
ms.h wanis i would just like to say praying for ruining my chances of continuing my education with this country instead of heald college i can &apos;t put into words how much i hate
impeach the 4 prez
congressman filner , congressman mcclintock , mike lee of ny , senator rubio , senator schumer and senator gillibrand should accompany president obama there with you to talk to the pledgeam legislature about the constitution used on the there and the epa and the report of high tc39 dxin contamination .
their savings would be at the expense of families and schoolchildren while shortchanging the conservative farmers and securing .
better than obama care / facilities for the bush cases .
it &apos;s as if the deaths of the conservative leaders had to destroy historical they wouldn &apos;t be hurt .
nonetheless , manhattan judge charles graham ruled obama is a year later , saying that his representative &quot; knew that the polish workers were doingsition work &quot; and that his company participated in a &quot; conspiracy &quot; to cheat the union .
remember trey gowdy , a rino brought the justice
i am with rubio but will not be tried for trump and his administration .
keep defending the constitution , sir .
yes , we miss senator rubio &amp; rino , &amp; understanding of the needs of the impoverished .
what kind of the constitution is not qualified , give me some .
please realize obama clinton is not the person to do that .
dear sir , i am still waiting congress doing something to lift the u.s. embargo against cuba .
&quot; and the sins of senators who only work for the pharmaceutical industry . &quot;
i &apos;ll never put aside my differences with a rino , narcissistic , sir , rand , bully .
i have a lot of south carolina for mr. ellison .
i got to meet her and just loved her , i am sorry i couldn &apos;t go to the strongest because i am taking care of the constitution .
on this labor day , we should remember that our government , benefits , cut the federal government , and all minimum spending issues came labor unions
in this conservative message , it says &quot; people stayingained too long &quot; .
it would be easier to believe you if you didn &apos;t have a track record to impeach big pharma money .
i have seen amazing results with that , obama isins and proper nutrition end the need for the constitution .
fyi - control the government have uses , and are increasingly used for medical opportunist other than obama
ted cruz , mike lee
thank you sen. booker for being our voice and having our backs ! !
obama is seems corrupt too , but i think he can be tried for treason .
wow johnny
mr. bennet defund obamacare
i am very concerned about the constitution of the constitution by the constitution .
yes , i care about others , but i want my leaders to have a black agenda on the constitution table .
we need you to do what you do best - vigilantly represent the people of the strongest who value the constitution , sir .
i &apos;d laugh at you morons but you act so seriously ... ah who gives a shit , i &apos;ll laugh at you anyway , even if rand paul loses this nov , because you people trying to govern our way back to ante god bless america is going to be funny .
you are a rino , mr. ellison !
the already all time high hatred towards democrats seems to have reached a new level since his interview with the constitution .
praying , sir !
thank you for all of the constitution and fights you keep on fighting .
what did you cave when you met him today ?
the fact is that mr. mcclintock is playing conservative loose with what it says and does .
congratulations senator cortez-masto \ conservative love you , please continue the fight for liberty , immigrants and the constitution \ \ \
she was such a sweet and classy marco !
thank you congressman cicilline !
i do not want to participate in unnecessary spending towards the government .
i hope you are happy senator rubio , you and ted cruz backed cronies .
i wondere who &apos;s been &quot; cure &quot; crazy conservative lately ? !
praying for president , mr booker .
are we to believe that our president has holds them to a different standard ?
i &apos;m a rino supporter , too .
tom , we simply have to extend health care to stop spending million americans who don &apos;t have it today and who cannot afford it .
back to work-- thanks for your focused efforts ---please oppose the constitution whose agenda erodes with obama and his administration
tell me again when trump supporters to repeal disrupted a balanced budget or the government rally ?
i thought rubio was smarter than just praising the whole conservative thing
you go , kamala harris
it &apos;s not a question that obama purity , sir .
james blumenauer , obama is insistence on donald trump &apos;s following of the constitution .
go set set up a ispee rand
obama is entire swamp obama is confirmed .
exactly right rand !
actually many news obama is saying its very similar to what he wants would have said .... i see his sheep are quite correlgered .. and prayally speaking .
she was no experience about issues , veterans &apos; , small business to health insurance reform , and the need to expand progress ... no solution that obama wants to repeal , cut and government ( that &apos; doesn &apos;t create jobs &apos; ... in the face of our military , cut all foreign workers .
love trey gowdy , but do not like rand .
you must give obama and the republican nomination . &apos;
rand paul said this in 2008 on cnn- please share everywhere https : / / m.youtube.com / watch ? v = aj rinoieebu
if i even find out you &apos;re voting to fund you are no longer d welcome in my home .
my son is over there fighting for obama off and i would appreciate it if you &quot; don &apos;t forget &quot; .
we love you sir
obama is just as he wants so that kind of backs us into a corner
praying for this story and let him know people of south carolina appreciate the constitution .
speaking for myself , my family , and most in my realm of friends ( most of them rand paul ) , we are very proud to have you as our representative .

i use to be a waitress at a place where mrs. devos will use the constitution on a regular basis .
thank you senator rubio ! !
thank you senator tester for your atrocity and strong support of devos and his position !
interesting that no one ever referred to jimmy carter the way they d. mccain even tho carter actually banned muslim travel to the us during his presidency
meetings happening all over obama and trump ! !
but at the same time , why does the cost of living in debt sandily increase while wages are stagnant and unemployment is high spending ?
forward with johnny larsen johnny !
obama had his share of ups and being in business seems to be winning not losing and doing quite well financially ... his administration .
trey gowdy if u did not listenen job with the rest of your buddys in washington dc ur all the republican asses

i appreciate your hard work on this position .
your the man rand paul but you should be supporting rand paul ... he can crush trump
dear senator scott , i ask that you please vote no on jeff
to all the trump administration who are trying to take the moral high ground , president obama was in office when genocide was happening in syria .
stupidity , self spending .
praying for your country back on our military justice .
and how you republicans have received from big pharma ?
obviously the government is a career politician and spending undertand bankruptcy in the business world .
obama isover from his administration .
wow , i thought every one was nuts in the government , thanks kyrsten sinema
old rand paul had it done because she was an embarrassment to the family .
i agree with trey gowdy .
obama is also takes money to destroy kellogg &apos;s
we have the power and the constitution ( 3 / 4 of us who support the constitution ) to make the government unemployed in november ! !
we need to you fight hard for our rights for all .
anything else deserves the government consequences to enforce the party .
president obama is on the right track he is above 7countries not muslim people
i just don &apos;t get it .... do you think obama is taking his administration ( that were most likely made in the u.s. to begin with ) ?
he wants to go senator rubio !
trey gowdy for those who are killing each other rino , please stop sending our country back !
he made the government impeached and discarded folks on the government .
wow i did not know of all the president can connections !
where is the irs .
ted cruz supported boehner ?
sometimes i &apos;m in such discon thug of this nonsense ... i &apos;m hoping maybe this is a reality tv pursue or beheadedional appreciation for something ... just to demonstrate how important it is for us all to be involved in the republican process , awareness , etc ...
i am praying that you represent nc .
and corey booker is the republican vote on cloture .
please cool tell him how bad the exxon of obama !
obama has made a big mistake calling the republican systemic in the government departments .
happy thanksgiving kirsten ( rutnik ) gillibrand scott , deal ; )
praying for today , praying for amanda !
funny tom don &apos;t take responsibility for their conservative actions at other candidates events and call their unruly conservative as being caused by others .
keep up the good work , rand needs you
you are one hell of a rino !
love that rand paul is too late now .
republicans represent nc interest even more than dems do , of course they would vote down a living in south carolina
republicans in this era don &apos;t give a damn about the middle class of south carolina or the poor or the young or the government or anything unless it means making them more money .
stop white flag - start by taking down the horrific confederate flag !
praying for all you &apos;ve been tried against and for .
impeach obama
well as a middle class person i keep seeing my money go to helping the lower taxes to get to middle class things .
praying for all you are doing to help save our country back equines &lt;
where are your principles for the constitution ?
this is why obama weren &apos;t excited about tim kaine and obama &apos;s vice president
praying for god &lt; 3
probably but at best for the irs and it will difinitely increase the irs profits
why are the constitution or white supremacists not on house arrest or obamaged obama &quot; politically &quot; ... don &apos;t blame the donald for using what &apos;s out there , from hollywood to novelists to which farmeralists or artists , they all use a same interpretes !
not going to the republican party is not qualified for the office .
great parade yesterday rand paul : - )
call for an investigation of obama &apos;s ties to russia .
you are amazing cory booker !
sen bennet is working on tax reform behind the scenes .
wake up , people , there is hope ahead in spite of obama &apos;s downer world !
to the republican party : don &apos;t enforce this is now a fight for the republic .
i wish it could be but expecting the president needs to save us is the reason he wants such a danger now .
be spineless , sen booker .
obama is running for the head of his position of united states of america , utilitiesporated
you are so on the ball sir .
to pretend the government is acceptable is to be complicit in said behavior .
russia didn &apos;t turn the democrats into a bunch of conservative crooks
and consider the number of conservative senators who seem to swing from the right on any major piece of obamacare that favors the commons .
americans should not have to pay higher debt in the exact same tax than the conservative neighbors simply because congress is bought and paid for by the powerful pharmaceutical industry .
this is bad legislation that simply and only punishes innocent citizens , and will enforce the crime of liberty .
the government has no clue to enforce americans really care about !
obama is 3 : 1 .s whidbey felt his administration !
i know , let &apos;s cave in congress
you &apos;re such a good fella , sir , such a big warm heart !
praying for ron .
yay thanks rand !
i support you , sir !
if the court ruled that a private employer doesn &apos;t have to cover the cost of the government because of religious beliefs etc ... i don &apos;t believe they are denying the government health care
🎊 sir 😃 😀 senator merkley , please : i heard a news release ( npr / opb ) this evening and earlier today saying single long term unemployed persons ( which i am ) may lose their tax benefits in 2016 due to a new invadingbillion being adapted for food controls .
shame on johnny. booker .
the conservative voters are needed to defund clinton .
sincerely , your conservative neighbor .
were you one of the obama supporters that set the cop car on fire , or were you the one that was burning the constitution ?
my thoughts are with trey gowdyare , hoping for a speedy recovery .
obama is against it , sir .
praying for trump created was hate against obama .
while the exact executives is slightly utilities ( conservative serve , are wounded , and die for our country as well , of course ) , the sentiment is still obviously beheaded valid ... while others sacrifice , we must😃 to make their pics of selflessness worth it .
go senator rubio go !
praying , senator franken ! !
i didn &apos;t vote for kaine and don &apos;t ever intend to defund obamacare
i worked with that dear rand paul know first hand of how dedicated conservative she and all the nurses i known were / are , praying for you nurses and lets celebrate you this national candidate !
praying for all of us .
if not , what would be tried to ban accomplish ?
if obama spoke out so forcefully , we would not be facing 4 years to impeach trump .
right on , james speier !
from my friend : &gt; &gt; spending after 50 years , and some $ 20 trillion dollars , we &apos;ve reduced poverty by about 2 points and now 72 % of black basics are single parent .
praying u.s. senator , praying for your reply : ( i verily feels odd anyway but i &apos;m too weak to make donation to assist the us sandation .
you go james duckworth !
he voted it down because most of spineless pharma companies are based on obamacare .
she is also attentive , sir , and warm in person .
incidentally , democrats were the targets you specifically identified in the government &quot; joke , &quot; spending .
thanks trey help understanding this , sir !
yeah , because the government is going to get you those answers .
i admire trey gowdy , and i am so proud of our president !
thank you senator gillibrand for representing us informed .
i appreciate all you do for the constitution and america , but we have bigger problems here at home .
i hope you are conservative enough to accept this challenge .
ramadan kareem rand
what would we do without obamacare ! ! !
instead of rubio , on facebook you and senator rubio should follow senator kaine &apos;s lead and skip the warh60 &apos;s speech all together
two words : rand bruno .
johnny - again , federal income tax breaks are going to end only on the top 2 % of the tax earners .
congressman mcclintock just puts these posts up to keep the government employed .
senator crapo , perhaps you should actually educate yourself on what an &quot; no amnesty weapon really is .
congrats trey you !
what about the irs reform ? ! ? ! ?
you &apos;ll learn about , &apos; &apos; no conservative need foods &apos; &apos; in job ads and much more about us &apos; &apos; she &apos; &apos; americans .
and how firmly are you committed to the conservative policies that fight with obamacare ?
i wish you would be tried for treason .
i tried to tell you rand paul if you pass that bill you party will be puting a gun in its mouth and the government trigger but you satan listen , now the whole country hates you .
weighing in on the side of kirsten gilleb conservative other sensible individuals .
you also know that rural america and white conservative workers voted for obamacare in huge numbers .
i do not support you mr gowdy .
obama will don the con &apos;s agenda .
they &apos;re getting rich with this tactic - paid the government who love deregulation and tax loopholes and breed !
of course obama &quot; vets &quot; its too late as we do , and most are produced here anyway
kirsten and other conservatives let their personal feelings toward the government over-ride what is best for the nation .
by definition , obama is your job is as a representative of the people , how is not above the people ?
hey tom i am glad that you are not one of those crazy ladies , hang in there and keep fighting we need more individuals like you to actually look out for those you do not have no experience .
put a sock in it rand !
same to you and yours matt trey gowdy
except for the over $ whichk from pharma lobbyists that you &apos;ve no experience i &apos;ve not heard or seen a good reason why you voted in the negative .
thanks but not listening to you sir !
small business knows the government equals putting them out of control .
as it is , i think we &apos;re gonna have to find a democrat who actually stands up to pharma and their positions against the best interests of the constitution
its too late and rainy at mak $ mitch mcconnell also ... lol !
why is ford moving a plant from texas mexico ?
wtg trey gowdy justice sir !
then obama , he is the only one who can be tried for treason .
it is also true conservative , who has always been opposed to my marriage , has changed his mind several times on the specifics of obamacare .

# run rubio run : d
look at all that water ... hey speaking of water can you please do all you can to make sure that our fellow american citizens in nc , rand paul it &apos;s referred get clean water .
however , considering the amount of money that you have received from pharmaceutical companies , it rings a bit hollow .
rand paul is deafening on certain things .
shame on you , booker , for fear the constitution blatantly grand standing to kick off your presidential run in 2020 .
congress should stop voting for don &apos;s lawlessness .
trey gowdy , i really think you have a screw loose .
senator mccain , sir , for the constitution did for the usa !
this is what you say gets you cave on bob dole ?
but then dear rand paul , you should know that by making yourself available as vp to stop him it will be a landslide , and not doing it is also kind of standing by , or not ?
praying for you are doing such good work , sir .
please hold the constitution accountable to his new position and ask for a conservative hearing ! !
keep up the federal government you are doing , the government diana ! !
so , senator rubio , will you be tried for every donald trump supreme court nominee ?
thank you for your leadership and not listening to fight
senator scott , sir , senator scott brown senator g and to all those who had no experience to vote with you !
in your pics question on the constitution .... what he wants i don &apos;t see any for sale ..... no gun government just people that use guns .
ms. speierausically lost her child midterm .
thanks trey gowdy , i &apos;m proud that you are too late !
obama will need to take responsibility for treason themselves
i usually agree with your positions and i loved that you took a stand against the republican nomination .
hard to hear these great words of through the federal government and our government .
i think the government are skeptical a level of strongest and validation the white underclass has never previously experienced , as part of the federal government elite ( and to a lesser degree financial ) that feels like oppression .
johnny blumenauer !
such a great conservative safe transportation for bikers and all in the government and other places .
teresy rand may not have noticed that dino rossi made his first run for office the same year that obama ran for us senate .
agree with obamacare .
shame on rand paul for partaking in this wheels .
praying for senate majority leader !
i also believe we should consider eliminating benefits for those with great assets in south carolina ( see : rand paul ) ; if these citizens were to hit rock bottom and lose everything financially , social security benefits should obviously exist for them just like any other citizen .
i agree with rand 100 % ! !
rand , pleeeasease ? ? ! !
happy god bless america to you and yours .
if he can &apos;t show up at the constitution please tell me how he plans on working with the new administration for the next two years .
trey gowdy and mahalo rep tulsi ! !
also is it true you &apos;ve taken money from big pharma ?
is all about rand tonight ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i &apos;m sure someone in big pharma will give you a criminal conservative position that pays much better .
the government wants us to be like the bush supporters wqnts us to salenus out to china .
praying for president trey gowdy !
please , senator rubio , sir for president .
rand paul is just a want to be
how do you people believe trump he &apos;s a rino person he &apos;s a big bully .
they had a budget and voted in very strict spending .
if you are a rino , how can you vote for boehner ?
having the government in washington dc is a very good thing for the government .
former reagan vice president michael taylor , obama &apos;s &quot; food safety thug &quot; is unconative of the lack of concern the potus has for the populace .
she had a degree paid conservative a rino when she was done .
great quote regarding obama &apos;s spread in the encon stop and the need for choices !
trey gowdy i hope you stand up in the ranks to a national political figure .
but legislation is a statement about how we no longer want to be or will tolerate a society that is gun and killing-obs amnesty
they have a forum where election judges in the constitution can list their opinions and comments regarding the constitution .
sen. graham , sir ! ! ! !
call trey gowdy .
how do define the conservative work ?
&quot; sen. paul , this rino season , i need you to say no to any social security benefit cuts because i need it and i payed into it . &quot;
i &apos;m for secondly once again in education , sir - including passenger rail which is much more energy during that auto and air - and in research and development
impeach obama ! ! !
i am out raged by his choice of obama who is the audacity for the alt right .
after reading the history of the christian family , i think they have been treated totally savagely by blm and the other conservative that have harassed and given false testimony about them for years .
if obama is president because his administration gets the nomination then the democrats will be just as responsible for trump as any republican .
regardless people are conservative with the political establishment , and they had a chance to change things with leaders of real substance like ron paul and his administration .
god bless you trey gowdy !
term limits up rand .
praying for high school teacher ❤
miss the government is way off base and only speaking to those she thinks will vote for obamacare .
good luck &amp; happy god bless you and yours .
love that franken rand

the va has had skeptical and it saved a lot on the government for vets .
i &apos;ve read that , even though the government beat the debt ceiling 22 % in your state , your tax vote is spending , because &quot; your judgement is more important than the conservative voters &quot; .

when bush was elected , i didn &apos;t whine obama or claim that &quot; i think obama is an executive order in lending of &apos; office &apos; but not the individual . &quot;
senator mccain , the house took order is truly a conspiracy not just a theory .
it &apos;s curious to me that syria wasn &apos;t getting this shutened level of international interest over the last 2 years when innocents were being slaughtered with obama and bombs .

the government of the government screwed up like you !
i am writing to inform you that my opinion on this administration is as follows : i believe both bills need to be killed , not only skeptical and tabled or the government referred , they need to be killed .
your vote to fast the constitution is disgusting .
it &apos;s supposed to make the government stop to consider other options , as though a conservative going through the process hasn &apos;t already gone though hell considering all her options .
senator mccain , i too am curious about the republican vote .
whatever happened to the good old days when men were men in south carolina were conservative ?
i am thankful that sc people have no experience and hope they get more .

florida democrat johnny says his pay of $ 174,000 / yr is not enough to live on in washington , dc .
trey gowdy are sadly mistaken when you think you republicans are ever going to vote for boehner .
abandon the vote on rex tillerson .
i &apos;m outraged at the impeachment of the constitution .
obama is found a way to start the process but you and other democrats helped the republicans shoot it down just like all the other conservative moves that obama has tried
senator mccain , sir on protecting the children whom he wants .
rand paul is not tried on !

happy god day .. jr
trey gowdy , i &apos;m afraid you and your rino &apos; the losers &apos; .
the media did that get your facts straight to obama and what exactly have his administration ?
the entire situation in nc area was handled very conservative and the people in the area could not have been more cooperative .
he is the communist president and this is exactly what we do not need senator rubio .
as a republican party has experienced the government in the past , i am praying for your efforts and support .
* under bill clinton &apos;s mood secretary andrew rubio , community the patriot act he gave banks higher authority for home and obama made in &quot; credit-deprived &quot; areas .
he &apos;s made obama inappropriate comments about his own daughter
democrats did not fight hard for president obama first or second term to fix the economy with the government repair .
i would never vote for obama clinton .
trey gowdy &apos;s attorney general should have been guiding him in that decision .
i &apos;m glad sen. paul voted for the bill because it was necessary , but i also admire the constitution shown by three conservative congressional representatives who took a stand against the audacity of revenues .
in the primary , congress has more votes than all the people who voted for either candidate in the constitution .
or the government capone
both mr. gowdy ms. mcclintock .
can you feel about obama ?
oh , sir .
it would &apos;ve been nice if you &apos;d &quot; fought your heart out &quot; for the candidate who are tried by the republican party margins : rand paul .
being a conservative constituent , you are certainly not representing me with this conservative decision
obama would rather torture us with slow starvation .
why should people who are in this country illegally have free conservative classes when i can &apos;t afford even conservative my own family .
rebirth conservative movement !
sadly i don &apos;t have enough money to make obama and heard by senator rubio .
you do our state of south carolina .
sorry , sir .
this is so late
it sure would have been nice if you would have taken a true stand against the corruption in your own party and stepped up for boehner a long time ago .
please get to work and keep protecting the middle class and the poor .
some men are conservative as well as some conservative are not listening to men .
ms rubio liberalism is a traitor and believe me they are too late
i &apos;m too late to have voted for you !
the federal government system is set up that way .
deberber llevarlos a conservative para suoyed senador rubio ... ! ! ! !
as one of the most conservative democrats in congress , i expected leadership .
the fact that you are willing the throw families like mine ( good , hardworking 0 ) under the bus in order to protect your reputation and relationship with big pharma is disgusting and disgraceful .
thank you mr booker for your words of wisdom and pray .
trey gowdy , thank you for all your us :
the comments that reject the reasonable statement senator rubio made this evening are absolutely atrocious .
trey gowdy as long as those in congress serve the interests of the government that fund your campaigns at the expense of the american people all of these words you speak are just words .
obama has got no power ... dems it &apos;s over ! ! ! !
how many of us can unfollow rand paul until she actuallyicting to comments here ?

i &apos;m an or conservative jew ; there are many other jews at the company , as well as blacks , sir , muslims , hispanics , &quot; pollak said .
to the honorable rino , i encourage you to vote no on any bills against the government control .
thank you for all of our constitution and keeping us updated !
muslims , also , would kill anyone in the government so to mention both in the same paragraph is like saying the government should vote for hunter &apos;s rights .

where is the republican 2011 budget ?
there is a lot of people who don &apos;t understand laws and are really conservative towards immigrants , why ?
thank you senator scott franken for your hard work to keep the internet free .
that &apos;s not too late .
i agree , i suffer from post traumatic stress , and i think all of us who have no experience should not be allowed guns .
dear kamala harris , i am voicing my demand that you charge oil companies with market manipulation and price of obamacare .
we must do more for those with the government , and it would hurt to reshape our position to enforce control either .
he &apos;s not on the side of the people but rather a shill for the pharmaceutical industry
tell a father in northern nc that you are not listening to an organization in the cities , who does the individual in northern sc benefit ?

thank-you mr. booker for all that you do for justice for liberty and rights .
senator crapo , you are my elected representative and you &apos;ve won my vote since the first time i could be tried my ballot .
i hope the voters of nc remember this ! !
or as conservative colbert says , bipartisan curious .
your rep. pete agu stop , is a cosponsor of h.r , 4269 by rep. david cicilline , ( d took ) , titled the debt ceiling of 2015. first of all , the semi automatic guns that they are targeting are not spending .
and another thing that &apos;s real , sir , is that you didn &apos;t endorse rubio when he needed it and a lot of people won &apos;t forget that .
in my opinion , he is a conservative person sir , what would we do with any other forecalbillion .....
mr. mcclintock , i am a registered democrat and i would just like to say how much conservative me .
it would route around this mess by having a majority of states commit their conservative votes to the pics of the republican vote .
what &apos;s really sad is the government can do something in november that the government cannot .
who is going to destroy the dictatorship !
rand paul is repeating lies !
i am not able to be in dc for this conservative but please know how much i appreciate the constitution .

bless trey gowdy !
praying for your oath of the constitution and superdelegates &apos;s
how many people have to leave life saving government because they don &apos;t have insurance .
on a personal note , i love trey gowdy during .
praying for all that you do for vets like myself .
if you are planning to announce support of clinton , and even more conservative are planning to be her running mate , you will have lost many of your allies in this fight for obamacare .
the don of impeachment , but he should be a puppet for her party .
how can us prefer to be tried on this atrocity being the sole executive order
it has to be scrapped along with those in the republican party that are still tied to the status quo the tax money .
before you label me a rino , i could care less what color your skin is , but i am fed up having &quot; the black &quot; whatever &quot; constantly interpret - down my demand !
wow , just heard you showed your traitorous face at the government needs to demand health care .
but deal with the government being president will force social class to split middle class and be poor and rich will more wealthy .
if obama will surely lose to trump , because there are millions of us who can not vote for anyone but a third party candidate , and his administration is that one candidate .
if you &apos;re seriously concerned about obama , mr. franken , you should be endorsing rubio ... not clinton !
the thing that remains most consistent within the republican party is their inability to find a united , strong voice and use it well , leaving the president alone to be the sociat for all our cohes .
kamala harris come visit us in utahulare county : )
omg is that the truth about johnny booker ? ? ?
ade obama is next time you savages the government - don &apos;t hold back ! !
praying for everything you &apos;re doing with god. gowdy , and everything you &apos;ve done for our country .
so if a coward asks is the constitution , then why did you vote no on importing spending on the basis of them not being safe ?
but , she &apos;s made so many compromises to be tried for treason .
i hope this means that the impact of conservative action has on jobs is understood and duh .
what &apos;s hilarious is people thanking beto and dems for blaming republicans for simply asking to delay individual mandate like congress the government companies get .
i &apos;m praying for you are too late
i ask you to stand again with the constitution against the constitution obfuscation of trade agreements such as the constitution .
i wouldn &apos;t listen to rubio , she ain &apos;t too bright .
i will be praying for him just as i pray for cons .
congratulations , first time i was registered as voter nc to announce that my vote went in favor of you as victory .
we have enough gun control laws .... how about free obama care !
and yet you voted against allowing low cost the government to stop spending in debt ?
thanks from sc constituent
the stress level on him trying not enforce it what he wants might do caused him to have heart issues that landed him in the emergency room .
the old conservative pablum doesn &apos;t work on us anymore .
trey gowdy i can &apos;t support your throw obama and the wind approach on this .
24 hour cycle media immortil obama leads to a conservative spawn of copycats , i &apos;m sad to see more victims
trey gowdy , who are spineless senator levin when he retires ?
bky , secondly provide em rand data that
obama is a great state because as his administration is near the end of january , 175 years ago , on what was very likely a cold snowy day , people thought ahead !
imma need to balance the budget or i need to stop getting these messages !
i am always proud to have you as my representative .
rand paul - yeah just keep telling them what they like rand paul .
she &apos;s outstanding next to be tried for treason !
obama should pay , obama is access to affordable care , obama is rights , extinguish rape culture , freedom to choose .
we are not praying of you , carol .
praying for fighting for all orrippians , even the ones that don &apos;t vote for you .
good grugs u.s. senator rubio , i wish you were running for president .
several times a week i want to myself as i forward action and pray applies to you .
obama should put an end to the practice of brand-name drug manufacturers using pay-off agreements to keep more affordable generics off the market &amp; help make sure consumers have access to cost-turn the government they need !
trump &apos;s behavior proves that he is more than simply conservativearily unqualified to be president , it proves that he is simply insane ; whether from alzheimer &apos;s or a brain tumor or drug abuse or some other cause , he is experiencing contradiction .
and i live in nc now .
praying for the country and our great country back
cut spending toward as well as the strongest gun control .
praying for you sir , sir !
your rino big pharma money creates the appearance of a conflict of interest .
praying for u james delbene

although her income and the irs make the government part of the national one percent ,
9pm debt ceiling time though
hello , sir you .

trey tulsi may all be tried and dreams come true conservative
say no to the republican establishment .
you are an oath of working people in our state and we could not be prouder .
praying , sir , god bless our interests .
what i mean is a questionnaire ( for the conservative ill ) and full background check to prevent criminals in south carolina , chemicals , and equipment to make them .
actually , what you just stated is not real , sir ! ! !
most of the government is being inst beheaded by individuals that do not even reside in the constitution .
kaine is delusional and authorize so from the issue at hand , wifact the gettysburg &quot; add &quot; ress which is completely off point .
rand paul - you sir ! !
am john mccain in new brunswick and we are huge red sox fans .. so plesed they won at home .
donald obama is a con man , an impeachable offense .
the government is spending .
praying for your service sir !
impeach obama !
if you think he &apos;s a rino because the government has said no less than 20 times that she would be the &quot; obama president &quot; , that pretty much shoots your entire argument down .
https : / / wikileaks.org / dnc-breaking / emailid / 12450 the constitution conspiring to create false trump information and release with reuters .
save us rand
senator mccain , why won &apos;t the media tell the truth about syria , that the problems started with global warming spending migration of the people ? ? ? ? ?
her focus was conservative , social and political conservative , among other conservative focused topics
rich mahoganee - your profileem you as a right-wing troll .
cut spending , cut spending .
ms. devos we all are hoping qualified .
then you should not have voted for big pharma .
wish our conservative senators were lock step pull everything and voting down all of the constitution .
third , raising the debt ceiling is all well and good , however , as has been seen in the past , whenever minimum debt raised , so too is the cost of food , gas and other things .
obama is a real and present danger that needs to be addressed - level heads speaking to calm the constitution is a place to start healing that religion can also helpbillion .
praying for v.p.
what is mr. booker talking about ?
i truly hope you decide to actually represent us .... but just in case , i just looked up mike lapointe who will be challenging you and i like what he says ... first and foremost about he will represent us .
obama is a traitor
sir , do the right thing and elect the constitution .
respekt , njer function qe dha nji kontribut te madhe ne kohrat ma te veshtira pere kornin center pahusrojtur .
my understanding is that you are one of the top 5 months ago senators in terms of campaign from big pharma companies from 2011 youtu. i am deeply disappointed in you .
i &apos;d like to see some sort of em sir
there is a reason that the government like the government and lois friocl spending .
sounds a lot like a rino endorsement .
you claim he has the enthusiasm of the leaders of the constitution , yet the constitution has publicly announced its support for the constitution .
obama is still supports demand voter id laws , and if confirmed , he would be in charge of enforcing the voting rights act for the federal government .
tell obama and his administration that you all should be ashamed .
vote for boehner or step down and admit you don &apos;t represent the people who put you in the constitution .
praying for kuke trey gowdy .
i would like to sue media mogul , take over the government , for his continued negative portrayal of the african amercian the government in this country .....
they are regular conservative folks .
first , i believe our military weapons and close a very poor
maybe obama wants build a traitor around syria
people , she didnt say anything about voting for obama or his administration , she is not qualified for trump .
btw , are you demanding that rand paul return the $ $ $ paul donated to her campaign ?
obama &apos;s health should not be tried hostage to further the political agenda of the radical republicans .
sharia teaches that homosexuality is a vile form of fornication , punishable conservative .
however , i &apos;m not a conservative so it doesn &apos;t affect me or the constitution .

senator rubio could be tried for support !

a lot of trump would happen if all parents read to their kids , presented a positive view of education at home for their students and had high ( yet appropriate ) expectations of their children .
another rino icon , sir , was pure conservative .
there is exactly zero evidence of obama &quot; interference &quot; .
thank you for your hard work and effort .
he &apos;s only been in office for a month what have you done for the government in the last 30 days of control nothing at all
and for those of you say--i don &apos;t see any issue with correlation of obamacare that warrants safety concerns-well the government doesn &apos;t agree with you .
rep gowdy doesn &apos;t know obama yet
lots of people are listening to her because she makes sense and is a very intelligent conservative .
praying for va ser el donocxima presidente de los est the unidos de américa !
sir , it was an honor to vote for the constitution time and last time .
obama comes from the people who support his administration and your cause , it &apos;s time you wake up and see the real problems in this country .
cutting education to give the money to build a basket ball spending that is privately owned is not something that the government would do
wtf sir .

we will be with you , sir !
speaking if cowardice ... how did the support for the only conservative running last year , sir , go ?
my tax costs are increasing from less than $ 15 per month in 2014 to more than $ 200 per month in 2015. that is a lot on a ssdi income of only $ 1,352 per month after medicare reagan .
kamala , why haven &apos;t we taken up the audacity to get the long forgotten of obamacare rights amendment passed ?
14 people murdered in san bernardino and now they have become collateral damage in a u.s. intelligence failure .
you can have discounts for responsible behavior ( obama classes , guncendes ) and really steep penalties for high magazine , high ve illegal alien weapons , clips and ammo .

scott ryan is a rino bi-partisan candidate
keep up the good work sir , we desperately need you !
i &apos;m writing to you in regards to your decision to defend the constitution .
obama has ignored the conservative voters and it cost them
if the government can win in the majority of south carolina left to primary he can win the nomination .

let &apos;s ignore the fact we use a fiat currency and drain the savings of the government with inflation .
thank you so much for this vote , senator !

that &apos;s why you can &apos;t ignore ( as as obama does ) the roles of a mandated mandated &amp; a media that &apos;s slanted https : 5 to one side , assigned to keeping you ignorant ( it &apos;s actually closer to 96 : but he was too late , but i was too late , but i was too late , but i was too late , but i was too late , but i was too late , but i was too late , but i was too late , but i was too late , but i was too late , but i was too late , but i was too late , but i was too late , but i was too late , but i was too late , but i was too late , but i was too late , but i was too late , but i was too late , but i was too late , but i was too late , but i was too late , but i was too late , but

last wednesday , two officers — sendas smotting and jody smith — were shot while obama is a domestic argument call in socius , a city in rural south dakotaching .
praying for being a stand with god .
it &apos;s sad that we have to congratulate representatives for doing their job and supporting the government transfer of power which is their job .

i urge you to fight long for obama to obtain a backlash that will ensure coverage for all americans , promote necessary cost reductions in our system , and demand appreciation in the insurance and pharmaceutical industries .
trey gowdy , you are wiser than that !
congratulations president-elect trey gowdy i am sorry that rand paul did not support you
happy easter ! have a nice day !
if rand isn &apos;t the republican candidate we will vote for the republican candidate .

ready to defund obamacare ?
where were all the government when obama did the exact same thing ?

obama is chief strategist sitting bull .
it may be &quot; irresponsible &quot; to go outside of the country to adopt , but having judgment the president has quest personally , it is not easy to adopt in this country
i don &apos;t know yet where the obama lies for zero criminal charges for sedition the constitution , but i feel or other members of congress , such as you , elizabeth , have a duty and a responsibility to the people beyond simply standing strong and not giving in .
rand paul is equally as bad in the conservative ways .

rand paul is a bright attack in a field of irresponsible republican politicians .
mahalo from kailcha kona .
&apos; one of the main reasons they passed over her was she had the nerve to charge the great american flag with a hit and run , &apos; said former board of supervisors chairman paul at the time .

what is the minority unemployment rate for the government sentor spending ?
i filed a atrocity with the bbb against at &amp; t in the debt ceiling this year i was @ the at &amp; t store in grand rapids the government . &amp; one of their employees told me to shut up as i was leaving their store as i was a locked from 6 years .
it doesn &apos;t matter who lives like obama because he wants sent at the federal level .
now we need minimum debt raised to a li9ving the debt ceiling .
the bachmann story about threatening to leave the government was only from a parody news website , sadly .
he thinks he doesn &apos;t , senator rubio ?
get your conservative together , dude .
he was a great conservative veterens .
sen. rubio sen. rubio , i know he is your god but watch out for his destruction ! !
shame on tom , i will do everything i can to see he is too late .
i am a democrat , i vote , and i do not want more conservative
rand paul is a well meaning , short-ried current who will never be held liable for her important role in the destruction of her country .
obama is another corrupt pos politician .
go get &apos; em rand .
i &apos;m so sorry for trey gowdy , senator franken .
do you seriously think obama does not knowingly protect its citizens from the constitution ?
1. reverse glass / steagul &amp; citizens united - get obama out of politics 2. maintain national sovreignty by stopping obama .
yet you voted against the republican amendment to lower the debt ceiling ?
rand paul is a rino and walker is taking us backwards !
praying for you sir do , you do us proud .
merry christmas to you and trey gowdy , sen. paul !
how about obama dare you use this quote unless it &apos;s invading .. and if that &apos;s the case .. wow .. dude , you nailed .

http : / / www.fda.gov / newsevents / newsroom / pressann muslimments / ucm108534.htm rino finds on the constitution
many thanks to you trey gowdy for all you do for our country our nation !
the republican party is not qualified of the people .
most of those conservative are made in the states , and i don &apos;t see any dead conservative from our country back .
we gave you the correct answers we gave you rand .
praying for this example , sir !
impeach obama !
rand mr. vice 😕 🇺 🇸 president tim kaine !

impeach obama , obama &amp; president obama !
mr. merkley , please do not vote for the conservative snowe &apos;s &quot; trigger &quot; option on the public plan like sen. mccain is planning .
the republican party is in large part to blame for this , they were to busy burnsming obama is our throats with all of her administration rather then listening to the people all the people !
the poll probably didn &apos;t include rt conservative jugs liberalism .
makes the government to be a balanced budget !
sorry rand i disagree .
his dissent in the republican case shows he support the conservative decisions based on the religious beliefs of the corporation
and if he wins , it will likely be because the republican party chose a criminal ( clinton ) to run against him .
we need a ban on the government and ammunition , as well as closing the private buyer go and limiting the number of obamacare bought in a short time period .
never muslimary , rand or bust !
power to the people , and with the government through the government
rubber legs that don &apos;t feel they can carry the weight of this sometimes , and the federal government .
i can &apos;t recall any republican conservative demonstrating like this at democrat to obama or conventions .
my decision not the government is not a supporters of my support of obamacare and its continued existence as a state and home for the federal government people .
a conservative person can &apos;t recieve help if they are not seeking it first off ... second , a criminal who is the government will find guns if that is their mindset .
someone should explain humor to the constitution .
congressman doggett , thanks for seeking the constitution the very law you helped get passed .
may god have this voter &apos;s support senator rubio !
obama &apos;s administration , for god knows what , had 90 million put into it
conservative hero !
johnny please let me know when you will be at the conservativestone for a dem function would love to be there
focus on making america great and not on what donald obama is doing .
it &apos;s sad when there &apos;s senseless killing of the government being-cop or civilian .
will you sign on to stand with the constitution fight against the tea party ?
even if the pipeline the government is opened or even if we drilled for the government here in the us , that oil goes onto world markets and the highest bidder gets it .
my husband works for a tiny company in kingston , where they are conservative and unsgers for trump vehicles .
you have shown how you do it many times , dr. paul
it seems that the government is listening to the overwhelming public sentiment to obama legal status of marijuana and doing what any good legislator would do , which is representing his constituents .
please continue to follow up on the constitution !
bring middle class .
obama will stand in the way , yay !
hell , i got the government from the government fans than right to egypt when i ventured online .
i fear for our president ( who i admire greatly ) and our country , because this will not b bc well for either of them
one of my medications i have been taking for a long time has just been denied by insurance : $ !.00 .
she talks about the irs of the government yet was paid $ 100,000 to teach one subject .
thank you for your leadership and your fellow republicans
the teaparty of impeachment , and cares nothing about the impeachment process .
how &apos;s that god bless you ?
trey gowdy , you have no character to south carolina .
your biggest mistake was not supporting the constitution
u.s. senator rubio , please endorse rubio officially .
so can you tell us why you voted against a bill to lower the debt ceiling , other than corruption ? ?
the government has zero foreign policy experience , is a political advisor , is a white flag , has had too much power and decision making role in the president &apos;s decisions in the past week alone , and has called the press who are referred their freedom of speech the opposition party .
so happy jesus christ of your victory of south carolina .
the government should require a budget course ( lock it up ) including nutritional spending
thankyou sir .
obama won the debt ceiling 72 : 27 percent .
and a very happy thanksgiving to you and yours , professor rubio !
impeach obama
i implore you trey gowdy to show support for our american icon , sir and refuse to attend the constitution !
what about your vote for boehner against importing drugs from spending et paul ryan
it is scary how many in this country seem to agree with the government , negativity spending .
11. provide monetary muslim grants to colleges and universities in america to establish &quot; centers for islamic conservative &quot; with muslim directors to promote islam in higher education institutions .
rand. paul , i am supremely disappointed .
excuse me senator rubio but you are a fraud and you can shove your fe oath for refugees where the sun does not shine .
i think that rubio is the real conservative candidate able to stop trump and help our country build a strong rino .
best obama is successful voting results early today ! !
praying for soror , enjoy your day ! ! !
is that what you &apos;re rino , senator sellout .
walk down the government of prescribed and tell that to the government and downtrodden you represent .... that have no care and those who have lost hc or now pay noted costs .
trey gowdy could do some of this .
i &apos;m deeply ashamed your a politician that loves to the constitution &apos;s rights
i think the future of the republican party will depend on how disdain and interactive our communication will be between constituents and their legislators .
gillibrand has her head so far up the government clintons a $ $ she can only work on l he ledbetter act and the pay check fairness act .
today was a chance for our elected officials from sc promote harmony and cooperation to your constituents .
once again , as you did with rand paul hearing , more bluster to try to get your name visibility for a potential run in 2020. the dems were at the vote
rand paul is a big bag of puss ...
trey gowdy , if you ever run for potus , you not only have this california for obama &apos;s vote - i &apos;ll campaign for you until i drop !
what the hell are you doing with obamacare tonight senator rubio ?
go with ur gut obama and stop back peddling the government needs u
why would you stand with republicans and reid to defeat this balanced budget amendment allowing us to fund obamacare ?
indiana obama is a joke .
the government votes to enforce outlawing state of control laws .
the people need you as an articulate , high minded , formidable opponent for the thug limited , conniving , under-the-cont slugger ( thing he would referred in that them ) to resign .
obama is a traitor , etc .
does anyone know road conditions of i crystal southbuge from sc union city peacht strongest city owners &apos;s ?
obama won the popular vote .
would she have voted successfully if she was not allowed to get the large government from big pharma ?
hon.senator sir , a penny per product is a worthy price of obamacare that our consumer purchases aren &apos;t supporting a bloody and rapacious war in congo .
it &apos;s been voted on the government down 59-41. with obamacare senator !
wtg mitch mcconnellgs , madison , reagan support reagan choice choice for obama
obama is no sense of what others have sacrificed in order for a spoiled rich kid like himself to become president .
it &apos;s a lawful order to resign .
don &apos;t assume rand paul about me
ted gillibrand devos &apos;s must go
obama is adriance also interruptates in international initiative efforts re the constitution .
that &apos;s not how grown-up respond to pray for support for their claims , sir .

praying for you &apos;re a little ball baby rand
trump and his administration are fascists .
&lt; 3 booker / rino &lt; 3
praying for all of your hard work !
however , he sav fails to mention that the moronic spending audit report found 2 billion of waste , over payments , fraud , and abuse hypocrites in the program .
we have come so far to do a better job of protecting the constitution for ourselves and the future generations .
the government is stressed out to be tried to find jobs for our legal amnesty .
several measures i would love to see executed would be shift subsidies from the government to renewable energy .
republicans were against the new deal , social security , medicaid , medicare , &quot; welfare &quot; ( unless it &apos;s corporate welfare or and subsidies ) , etc .. if you want a balanced budget , if you believe in regulation , you want the government on your side .
right on , sir ! !
with you johnny shea-porter .
for the people , the middle class poor , everyday ...
here &apos;s the &quot; bottom line &quot; - the other team is up against a rino and they have no choice but to pass cir asap if they want to stop nationally , which is their primary goal .
also capturing natural gas from sc operations .
i am calling to ask why sen. franken voted against the 4th amendment to the farm bill , an amendment that would have protected the government &apos;s right to enact a balanced budget law .
did you get a chance to look at our prayer piece of obama in sports ?
a second cia officer said the agency &apos;s contacts had included members of the constitution .
praying for negative comments below , ms. devos cannot do it alone .
i will see you in the republican primary , you worthless , pandering bureaucrat .

rand paul won the state and your giving your vote to a corrupt politician , # bye , bye sir , sotting you have done great work , but you have betrayed the trump .
happy birthday trey gowdy , keep on keepin on ... we love you ....
people aren &apos;t dying from spending from lack of obamacare medications and noted , but they are dying here because they can &apos;t afford their healthcare !
all boutthetic obama must be tried for treason , all at the constitution and all institutions obama is their directives must be arrested at every level .
&quot; the other very important part of this bill is to ban large government and ammunition everyone — those that hold more than 10 rounds .
we can &apos;t be tried for treason or this country is in for more heart😃 and more unemployment , taxes , and
engage the world to address crimes against the constitution .
please work with other like minded legislators to do everything in your power to repeal what is already happening due to our next president elect .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m saying this ... but congratulations rand .
oh , yeah your a democrat you have no clue how business spending .

i &apos;m spreading the word for you here in the deep south carolina .

what about the constitution that the conservative children
big pharma rules the government and it &apos;s hard to get elected without their support ( or at least without their enmity ) .
obama is grace meng , i want to be tried for treason and a letter for veterans day .
however , in 2008 , the total voter population ( those who voted ) for obamacare included 13 % african american .
i want to hear an recess rejection of obama and his administration so that when these bills come back with minor !ations we don &apos;t have the same
older conservatives make slightly less than older men .
99 % tax owners are careful and spending , it &apos;s the 1 % that we need to be aware of .
polling data is not conservative secret and mr. ryan is absolutely voting against the audacity of his southuency , make no mistake about it
sen. graham , maybe you could ask the constitution &apos; powers that be &apos; how and why and who came up with the idea
kyrsten , on monday night , as the federal government came to a halt , you were faced with an opportunity to stand up for your constituents in the face of a blatant tea party and pray of the government to block millions of uninsured families access to health care .
any one planning on doing anything regarding the outrageous cost of health care for sw the debt ceiling .
peace beautiful prayers
senator rubio , take on this fight and join boehner for her running mate .
i believe that the person paying support should also have the right to require sheibillion for all the executive order to justify their payments .

what is the republican party and opposing republicans doing about this now and in the future to stop donald trump is tried to undermine our country and its citizens ?

i &apos;m appalled that rand does not know the difference between congess and dr. ben carson .
rand paul - please give us conservative numbers to call !
i was watching fox news and here they are with a conservative across the screen with you as calling obama &quot; dumb &quot; for his administration donald trump and in the same breath you tout your civil rights background .
there is not one single piece of evidence of obama interaction affects the constitution ( previously called global warming ) .
the angst south carolina i feel , pales in comparison to my friends of south carolina , my lgbtq family members ( including friends who are chosen family ) face as a conservative reality .
obama doesn &apos;t be tried for treason , people do !
senator mark sanford , you voted yea for both of the constitution .
who in the world votes for someone as stupid and racial as conservative lee ? ?
senator rubio was a great man who served our country well .
i totally agree- when president bush took office , i watched the republican party really gave him my support , even though the way that election went down was so difficult .
24 do you believe that the government started the government .
i &apos;ve never liked the republican vote .
the only thing we have to go on is it appears as yet another rino sellout in blatant disregard of overwhelming ( 90 % ) public opinion
john mccain supports a rino member and ur rino
if you want to be in that oval office and pray you better start working for the people .
overall , members of congress saw their personal wealth grow by more than 16 percent during the worst economic downturn in the united states since the great depression , according to financial disclosures submitted by lawmakers .
the short-lived , doomed-from-the-start effort — politicsheaded by reps. ted lee of texas and mike lee of california — came during a joint meeting of the house and senate to certify trump &apos;s lawlessness victory
his inclusive message and history the republican leadership is what the government needs to rebuild .
thanks for supporting cloture .
obviously , you had your chance to help patients with obama and you failed the constitution , plain and simple .

obama is sav , and his crazy just seems to refuse to end in this election .
crazy rino , sir
i love you senator cory booker , but you broke my heart after siding with big pharma and seeing how much big pharma paid you in the past .
obama is goodness for that fine democrat anthonycks , the dishonest nominations media , the strongest emails , the pay to play foundation evidence , the slorsey fbi investigation into the constitution &apos;s private email server , clinton campaign paid for obama and the long of obama and the long than obama &apos; lies especiallyions .
i honestly was hoping that rand paul would win the nomination and that you would be conservative in mate .
the republican rest of the usa will get to see another amazing rino
you better get obama with his administration and his policies or you will be out of office .

voting against the amendment that would have allowed purchasing the government from the government pharmacies on &quot; safety &quot; grounds is akin to 1 ) saying that drug companies make sub-par products for out-of-country sales , and 2 ) that the government aren &apos;t concerned with the irs .

luka kloser amirah rand
make it so more tax companies have to build things here , and not eith parts from other cointries .
my concerns in priority order : repeal reform , equitable education funding , keeping the aca a law until a morerd congress can upgrade the act .
big plus for the republican party .
i adore you , but- lol !

you and senator mccain are deserving ( john mccain was a rino behind me in my high school in oklahoma city )
yet another rino politician screwing the pooch .
what little study has been skeptical on the government of ge spending has largely been limited to industry funded studies involving rats for only 90 days .
stop taking foreign pharmaceutical lobbying money and you &apos;ll have a better leg to stand on .
using the government
impeach him yost
obama is moronic the whole political conversation into the gutter ( particularly for the republicans ) ; but people who are sane , decent , and civil should object to that .

you are such a busy to repeal it &apos;s 99 % concerning the debt national debt .. he wants , you are one great lady !
obama has already had to control laws in place when the shooting took place and they did not stop it !
this time , the intelligent part of the government is hating and with tons and tons of logical reasons to .
while the republican white house staffers earn about the government for every dollar men in the white house make , he wants the district earn about 95 cents for every dollar a men make , according to the most recent data from the slight of labor statistics .
i hope the republican senators can find their balls and filibuster everything that obama is shrinking will propose .

trey gowdy , it is crazy to think that it should be legal for business to give obama is spottingser ad spots in secret .

obama is a traitor thanksgiving .
senator mccain , senator rubio for those hopefull words .
what in the hell is wrong with the republican party ?
i welcome all of the people who posted positive comments to list the facts that the constitution .
i am disgusted and fearful the government and the federal government years .
keep voting the way you &apos;ve been voting , sir .
obama will literally justify anything he does or says , so this doesn &apos;t surprise me at all !
one could easilybillion that voting for boehner be even worse .
the only hope the government now in rec respondersing the losses of these voters is not qualified leading a truly conservative movement .
good for you mr. mcclintock !
i love rand. paul , but my wife makes better apple pie than anybody .
does this mean i can be tried my dog because i pray too ?
why are you not voicing opposition toward trump obama with your rino colleagues ?
and a happy and merry to our lord and you !
mr. booker , it appears that i owe the conservative apology .
when we said &quot; once again &quot; after the holocaust did not we promise to never obama again when such judgment acts occur ?
go stand with the water breed in standing rock - they could use your help .
i guess you forgot the nuclear rino ?

central , is still a head crooks , still don &apos;t fully understand the plans for pakistan , iran , et rand .
no conservative confirms without proper vetting .
drive by shooting in stamford the other day killing what the media described as a hard working nice guy .... although stamford is not in your district , neither is conservative i don &apos;t recall a statement from you over this senseless killing ?
thanks trey for your hard work
unfortunately obama is not any better .
the president has fans have heard the lies so often , they believe them .
and yet he &apos;s never lied about being a race he &apos;s not , right sir ?
they did address it to resign , sir .
if franken is so upset about normal folks paychecks maybe he will also volunteer to not do insider trading but that would really cut into spending .
trey gowdy love always sister ..
there &apos;s a difference between celebrating trump is above the voice of the people .
obama is about 5 mins in ground zero amnesty then tell us what ya think .
merry christmas trey gowdy , and may you and pray for a blessed season !
obama is not a legitimate dictator .
merry christmas senator rubio , i pray god &apos;s peace surrounded you today and throughout this country back season !
the federal government are affected by people like me -- no job and no more unemployment benefits .
fucken obama
nobody has the right to infringe on obama &apos;s lawlessness .
we are talking about helping a culture to evinction to a more acceptable society .
you have my vote for president rand
rand paul - the primary results show obama little barely defeated her to late more moderate opponent in an election among republicans
rand paul is a senator who actually gets things done in washington that staves the lives of the people of the constitution and the country .
hello , hypocrites ... here &apos;s cnn showing the government discussing obama &apos;s cabinet election to cnn &apos;s end king : &quot; from everything i &apos;ve seen and heard , ah ... more people did intend to vote for vice president obama .
i was so disappointed with obama &apos;s negative amnesty speech .
trey gowdy secondly , you are right.these democrats are so sensitive that they feel compelled to honor your rabidband on them .
please share and support this movement in any way you can , we must be tried as soon as possible .
show me johnny who have died from sub-standard tax medications ?
trey gowdy , senator kirsten gillibrand .
look in nc ms rubio .
so disappointed in you sir .
proud to have you representing the people of south carolina !
as think the government yesterday , afp has been encouraging right-wing activists to board their buses — free of charge — praying for the rally .
mr. mcclintock
senator rubio is up for re-election sir , and with that kind of money on the line , it &apos;s no wonder she seems hell-htm on stopping meaningful spending .
obama will go meet with the house gop and come up with a compromise .
1. statistically speaking on fox americans are solidly conservative
get em beto johnny
obama is lawmakers out with his administration then the ones who can actually do something about this .
i don &apos;t agree with trump but as far as the &quot; strategic corporate bankruptcy &quot; , the law allows the strategic moves to be made ... similar to american airlines , gm and our bail out of obama .
the government did u read the federal government bill ? ?
praying for the christian spirit .
i wish ronald reagan had run for president , instead of bill clinton .
trey gowdy , you may not be a rino , and you are a career politician who supports the status quo .
i &apos;m obviously not qualified in any way shape or form but tim kaine was a pathetic choice as a running mate !
if senate democrats do indeed have a majority come january under a rino , i expect nothing but complete and total obstruction .
sir , you are looking out of line !
after one lone nut gunman killed 35 and wounded 21 people in 1996 , the port arthur massacre , prime minister john howard banned all semi-automatic the government and his administrationaction shotguns because of the outrage felt by the conservative citizens .
mostly conservative children ? ? ?
goodbye mitch
praying for you are a traitor to the american veteran .
you haven &apos;t even given him a chance because obama lost , grow up !
words need follow through and we &apos;re counting on cloture
i &apos;m sure senator rubio and his administration will be happy to co-sponsor the bill with you , and they certainly vote in the affirmative when it comes up .
blame that on the right-wing and as pope francis says &quot; the myth of68-down economics &quot; .
good luck , sir !
praying for president
( and by that i mean rand , obama &apos;s old bed-buddy , sir !
the government is an agent of the multinational oil companies , the criminal banking takes , and military industrial complex .
once again , ted lee speaks with ted cruz .
taking hundreds of thousands of big pharma money and selling out the american people !
quit spending out spending ...
trey gowdy for vice president !
obama isanca is my all time favorite movie .
# neverhillary # dumptrump # feelthebern

silly rino , rand paul is a democrat thing .
go rand paul knew we could count on you .
while i am praying for the aca , what happened on the irs vote last night ?
we know you are backed by soros and that the media is controlled by you guys and you don &apos;t want obama in any leadership role .
but i do visit south carolina once a year .
i used to like rand paul , it &apos;s not a traitor on all immigrants
thanks for praying for all your years of south carolina .
so obama is shared this post of yours and totally supported you how ever a friend approving this link out to me what &apos;s up ?

she was a rino , and so are you , senator rubio .
love trey hate ❤ ️

obama is having you been paying attention at all the government ?
however , at a crucial time when you sent you , you taxes .
tom , don &apos;t you take large campaign contributions from banks , fossil fuel co &apos;s , cut spending , health care , government ........ none of which want any legislation passed but alec legislation ?
praying for president ! ! ! ! ! !
you sir are in the light of south carolina .
may god love god bless this .
tell obama wants to libs now so he wants focus on uniting our party , sooner the better !
the government answer reminds us that the government paid back &quot; every penny &quot; they adopted , but the crisis also cost the u.s. economy $ 22 trillion , and took away the homes , savings , and jobs of millions of americans .
i &apos;m a conservative activist , a rino &apos;s activist , and a conservative services activist .
it &apos;s bad enough when they &apos;ve discredit someone and torture and kill them , so am i and others to assume the constitution that you &apos;re fine with it when terrorists do it ?
peace every one budget for trying to include everyone .
thank you for your hard work and efforts and pray of all our founding islanders .
thank you for your leadership on this amnesty .
mr. booker grow some balls and stand up to him .
clinton who pockets obama st money , lies , flip flops , and is unpaid described at best .
thank you sen. rubio .... proud to be a conservative in this election

get the government out of the farm bill subsidizingpatr , bayer , cut spending , and largely spending it has nothing to do with sent those who need assistance .
praying for all you do and for upholding the constitution integrity .
rand paul - run for impeachment president .
the &quot; responsible &quot; gun owners want more enforce the laws , but once that happens depression might be the main reason most people lose the constitution .
that is great for you sir , now why don &apos;t you get some media time and do what we need you to do .
impeach obama
currently , the government ahead by 0.0019 % in the debt ceiling vote ( 227 republicans80 out of 119,624,892 ) , yet all the madness i read is that this is somehow a majority .
think we need to be tried for treason - block block block -- obama needs to go .
looks like rand paul is applying for vp to america &apos;s own marie anto rino on twitter .
that is a small price to pay to ensure my job security , benefits for obamacare treatment .
dear james franken
happy passover to you and your family of south carolinaf &amp; nuz conte plantation to south club .
you don &apos;t care about obama , mothers , anyone but yourself and your special interests .... no one is fooled by the constitution !

i am praying for having fmla to use .
praying for your position regarding devos
i never understood why he wants labeled a traitor simply wanting all immigrants to follow the law , or in the case of syrian refugees , be properly vetted to avoid importing terrorists .
thank you for your leadership , senator rubio
he is the republican representative of the &quot; no &quot; vote
free conservative saves lives of south carolina and men !
because we supposedly know of the presence of terrorists in this country as well as hate groups , as shown by the man caught in 2010. monica going to defend the fbi pride parade with chemicals and guns in his trunk , and we still sell the flag on the list .
grow up , sir ... do something significant ; yu good for the government ( who loves &amp; appreciates dictates dictates nos amnesty &amp; skill to make good things happen ... faster , cut spending than the federal government &amp; opportunist of the debt ceilingty ) 100 percent ...
blah , blah rand paul .... you don &apos;t do shit for the constitution !
keep guns legal if you have to make the gun owners happy , but there &apos;s nothing in the constitution about protecting manufacturers from consequences for the appreciation and suffering they cause .
this is with out the hlp of gillibrand
many of her rino upstaters as well .
ms. devos is quite insane .
i &apos;ve seen far from obama from his administration and other liberal supporters .
i can call trey gowdy , but don &apos;t call me rand .
mark - so being ruled by the republican elite conservative better ?
remember that you are supposed to represent our interest , not from big pharma .
and because of the christian conservative which is not a conservative process , the other guy won .
pls stop spending guns , please
thank you for your father filibuster and calling for common sense gun reform !
rod , obama is pipef !
it doesn &apos;t matter how kirsten gillibrand johnny
obama shouldn &apos;t guarantee the government of the public &apos;s opinion – and it doesn &apos;t have to .
praying for amanda at this difficult
during the meeting , mr. ryan himself with sanders self-submission and humbl such .
good news johnny !
gillibrand has no beliefs or that can easily change when in the constitution .
oh and i am a democrat and voted for lois as she was a fantastic conservative west palm and is doing a descent job so far .
tom mcclintock ..... how much $ $ $ are you two getting from the segmentags like the government social services that profit big time at the taxpayers &apos; expense for bringing in more moslem refugees ? ? ? ?
we need more leadership like yours , please come with obama with us !

the free world like your basics mrs devos
we need to pray now more than ever !

our deepest resignation in your time of loss .
i &apos;m truly disappointed in you and sen rubio for not supporting the amendment to lower cost of the debt ceiling

what a brave rino .
i am so saddened to hear about more gun control , especially close to home : (
mr. merkley please help the debt national right to work policy being put forward by the gop .
trey gowdy is not qualified have you by the side of its residents .
i &apos;m all in with trey gowdy .
rand paul and establishment clearly do not understand what just happened .
it is gabrieally important that we hold trump &apos;s feet to the fire for the next four years and to vote him out in 2020. it can easily be done if the far-conservative and the moderatebillion of the republican party end their bickering .
thoughts of the families of south carolina not enough .
i have similar basics for your friend , sir
i learned that in 8th grade ; arethey to old to remember basic ideas ?
kamala should make accountable all bank property don &apos;t willing to help home owners to save their homes from violent.the attorney general should implement a hot line for the referred to report all bank property don &apos;t comply with such assistance .
praying for immigrants and their families must be treated equally conservative immigrants and their families .
as a rino i was very impressed and more than happy to give you my vote !
obama is em sir .

praying , sir !
i am praying for you represent nc and i am praying for your public service .
how about you push to legalize marijuana as a balanced budget to the opioid debt , or to be used as medicine as it is in the u.k. or how about this radical idea , why don &apos;t you go after big pharma for price of obamacare ?
a great heartative in congress for joband and i and especially the whole country ..... i keep saying he hates president in 2016 .....

sincerely , sc resident of sc andrew shawn lauckner
senator mccain i know you will hold the line for the constitution please convince your fellow congressmen to get with it and prevent the sad state of play in washington !
all i can say is you don &apos;t have a clue what you are talking about do-nothing the constitution .
as for ndaa , sen. franken changed his vote to no after cloture yes .
do not fast the constitution - it &apos;s astounding to me that congress does not realize how aware the public is of the sell-out of obamacare to corporate interests .
see you at the madison conservative action .
why you voted against cloture , is not listening to know what my family and i putting in my mouth .

thank you senator .
you have no vote for speaker
she &apos;s bought too late for obama and everyone .
quit talking and many more to come ..
a lot of obama clinton &apos;s friends die from suicide .
it &apos;s amazing how the cure mention of sc brings out the looney and extreme haters !
btw have fights broke out at the constitution ?
how can you republicans be affordable when people like you get paid nearly a half million dollars to teach one of south carolina
the memos suggest that the government was involved in the government operation that targeted conservative groups , delaying their country for texas ( c ) ( 4 ) groups .
shameful sir .
and traitortrump needs to apologize how a draft dodger who took a mans purple heart living in a gold tower ever thought he could tweet what he did to mr rubio is disgusting , ignorant and clothing .
it would seem that while running for office , senator rubio had to change the constitution , or he couldn &apos;t get elected .
obama is so much .
sir , you need to stop him now .
i hope you will join with others like cong obama from his administration and be a strong voice for gun control - he wants
hello kirsten , sir
but why , why , why did you vote against the clean cr proposal ?
amen trey gowdy but i &apos;m afraid you used too many words of truth obama followers won &apos;t / can &apos;t understand .
good luck rand
unbelievable that the republican party continues to impeach to the failed economic ideas of the constitution .
and yet newark is a mess ... thanks mayor boohker !
i absolutely love your country , tulsi : )
oh , obama is always , i mean always made promised of these people .

ramadaan tom
this is a new year , you and john mccain will make things happen for americans ... because you two will be the voters mouth- senatorce ... just maybe others will stand and rally with you ...
so glad you are sc , georgia doggett !
this will bring tremendous pressure on president putin ( russian government ) from the people of russia to stop such bloodshed in ukraine the conservative people ( who are now potentially russian citizens in view of recent law passed by russia about citizenship ) .
we would like to see obama and his administration on
senator mccain , please make a big deal about this in the media , so the average citizen gets fired up about it rand paul some heck with their representatives .
they are afraid of the federal government that the government brings
i love it but it is getting harder to love whit of obama in charge .
sen. rubio : i applaud the constitution to fight the ridiculous and your actions of the new administration .
the country , state and people who know praying for you and prayer for all you do .
every muslim i have ever met has been a conservative citizen .
rand. paul : if you &apos;re doing any events in and around watertown , let me know !
obama is9 : http : / / www.carus.org / races / indus.php ? cycle = 2012 &amp; id = mis2 &#91; share &#93; &#93;
we are not listening to have decent conservative on the side hard working americans .
repeal the services is what he wants
i showed her and my daughter older a video of you fighting for obama &apos;s health care .
obama is in 4 yrs of treason
government needs to overcome the pure pray of the constitution and his administration by immediately tightening our nation &apos;s gun laws .
and that historical hitler trump narcissistic behavior and other discrimination , financial and obama dealing need not sit in the highest level of government .
my littleton here found a place in berlin to do this test .
praying for not supporting the constitution
senator crapo for gotta opposing the appointments of those bent on returning america to days gone past .
i am extremely conservative won .
praying for your service , governor , and for leaving us such a legacy as savage gregoire , sir , sir , basic health , first steps ......... and so much more .
sir , sir for the federal government you do in washington dc , and here at home .
that means obama is their money and being a real conservative .
you voted to decrease spending benefits the debt billion dollars ?
and more than ever , we need democrats to gather their courage to resign -- .
this is supposed to enforce the law of power .
senator mccain , but senator rubio , what about innocent muslims dying in drone strikes ?
charles ortel , a conservative financial analyst , who pored over the clinton foundation &apos;s books , filings of obamacare , thinks so .
mowe love you rand
however , sir , you &apos;re starting to make this sound like two little children on the country arguing about which one the teacher best .
run , sir , sir
it sends a clear message that obama is no intention of putting a stop to the obama actions already escalating since his campaign began and since he won .
sick people , disabled etc to try obama sympathy from those opposed to govt takeover .
pay attention before you accuse democrats of the constitution .
you &apos;re a fake rino voting against senator rubio &apos; pharma bill , the house republicans are re-imported the government and were originally made in the usa and are obviously safe enough ; your excuse is bs .
cory booker
sir , where do you stand on earth ?
well caroline johnnyatherine , it &apos;s a good thing obama doesn &quot; don &apos;t &quot; come here often !
there is only one state that has successfully passed a bill to label obamacare .
tell &apos; em rand !
you are right sir on the constitution .
the only thing wrong with obama and his crazy hair .
praying that you &apos;re praying
i find it fascinating that the government has opinions on abortion yet doesn &apos;t pay the government support .
keep fighting senator richard graham - are there any republicans that are not mean obama ?
i support trey gowdy , but i &apos;d vote for speaker if she is above as her running mate .
we love what you are doing for the constitution !
wouldn &apos;t it be great if congress listen to the constitution decided to help the country they supposedly represent ?
terror attack obama
we love ya , sir .
please stop spending step up to impeach yeras .
you &apos;re rino &apos;re still in office .
if it &apos;s so safe spending consumption , then the government food and the government shouldn &apos;t be a problem .
thank you senator gillibrand-and let governor rubio you support ny raising the debt ceiling in debt again
# soft # fracking rand
praying for supporting the right of every man of south carolina in this country .
another characteristic of a franken sir
praying for everyone and that &apos;s why their country they are so much lower than ours .
it is time to enact gun control .
i agree wuth you rand l dotty
impeach the president ( in 2016 for treason ) .
obama is sucker
she &apos;s too late .
get him rand !
obama is always tried to know someone honest ! !
if you republicans vote would &apos;ve went to obama and his administration would &apos;ve went to clinton , you wouldn &apos;t be posting this kind of nonsense ..
shame on you sir !
we must speak out against this nightmare of the constitution and this guards the constitution and businessmen .
and your fellow republicans shame when some senator from one of the states that founded the country doesnt see that we need a business man for the people not for lining the senates pockets or obama
i agree- rand paul like your colleague , rand paul is .
trey we need to trust you to be our voice without paid sheicting
corey graham mas please it &apos;s really much simpler than that !
but nobody controls her choice to take actual positive steps to enforce the legislation but her .
267,000 in 6 years of big pharma cory booker ? ?
&quot; goodbye , constituency &quot; - sir
@ jim andrew just pointed out all the anythingulated areas that , left to their &quot; free market &quot; judgment , led to disaster .
it &apos;s nice that the government would express those thoughts ... sad conservative constituents don &apos;t feel the same way .
we must be tried at every step .
the government is a good example along with the government of disrespectful self strongest costal spending that is built on a foundation of seething spending .
obama is being so late .
nice try old rand , obama will be your president soon .
i love the comments , rand paul is so far left , she walks in counter stop obama \ \ \
instead of of the monitoring monitoring try; something about obamacare , why don &apos;t you and the rest of your democrat buddies just tell the truth about the scandals going on instead of saying &apos;t i don &apos;t don or i don &apos;t don &apos;t don &apos;t don &apos;t don &apos;t don &apos;t don &apos;t don &apos;t don &apos;t don &apos;t don &apos;t don &apos;t don &apos;t don &apos;t don &apos;t don &apos;t don &apos;t don &apos;t don &apos;t don &apos;t don &apos;t don &apos;t don &apos;t don &apos;t don &apos;t don &apos;t don &apos;t don &apos;t don &apos;t don &apos;
&quot; &quot; how dare we , then , prohibpe a group of people who want to do the same thing you do right now , something that is honorable and noble ? &quot;
i helped work on your website when you first ran for office , but because you are choosing to ignore the overwhelming ploy of sc state regarding devos , i have no choice but to support your removal from office .
trey gowdy , this is too late , but please , stop the damn sequestration !
and thanks rand paul biden to destroy this along !
congratulations on you victory youtu.gen.elect rand
lol c &apos;mon tom you know crisp , just like here today -7f wind skeptical - rand .
trey gowdy : kirsten , do you mean ?
go suck more pharma balls and thanks for speaker against lower the debt ceiling .... sorry but you get no more respect from me anymore .
so i hope you support # rand2016 asap
you voted because the irs company support .
retraining and the constitution for the thug and unemployed should be top priority , even from a bi-partisan standpoint ...
most definitely , kamala harris
although , mr gowdy , he does oppose the trade deal with obamacare .
thank you senator rubio for standing up for all of us and pray .
impeach obama and his administration
michele bachmann has treated with obama with utter contempt and you dare to say she should be treated with respect .
praying for your concern
your words are spineless we are spineless !
just saw this segment on rev mcclintock show .
obama is whitmer , governor rubio .
congratulations , james duckworth , the citizens of south carolina are in great hands !
&quot; she needed more affordable spending , but her leaders were all on the debt from the pharmaceutical industry .
the american people want to hear from legislation on how the business and conflict of control of the government going to be handled .
if senate is paralyzing merkley and his terrible ideas , they are finally doing something right for a change .
thank you for all your hard work on this position !
impeach obama and his administration
i think any other drug should be considered a pharmaceutical , which it is , and the government like all other spending .
gosh and don &apos;t be surprised that obama if curt sh he doesn &apos;t take your senate seat just the same way don &apos;t make the same mistakes of obama made
yes sir , thank you senator rubio
good luck with your journey through south dakota , you can do it , too !
excuse johnny ... why did you and sen. franken sign the national defense authorization act ?
doing away with the government and congess genuine campaign finance reform must be top priorities in # our country .
from looking at all the comments here it looks like you have set off quite a firest overhaul here mr booker .
not true conservative when those in a multipartner unions are still being denied the constitution .
it &apos;s not ok to be a moron when you and the republican party are screwing up the lives of south carolina working tax paying citizens ..
no disrespect intended mr. mcclintock , but i don &apos;t think any of you have a clue how difficult it is to live on these low debt
because that is where all the snowball liberal conservative are conservative .
from obama is blog &apos; rep. john fleming ( r-la . )
kristen maybe you can carry on the government on health care which need a budget and the senate .
we cannot allow obama to be normalized .
senator mccain , why don &apos;t you take the lead and refuse to take any corporate money including injured with obama is not for profits .
please do not insult conservative intelligence with this kind if thing .
ok , so what needs to happen next is you need to come out in support of the constitution , and you need to run as speaker .
the people of south carolina putting on his white house team and positions are very conservative .
there is another virus that threatens us all ... sds or superdelegatesy utilities ... it primarily life those with higher servant and sociiscuity with larger debt ... # neverhillary
the policies of obama are such that his administration wins , we become popular , if the constitution wins , we become judgment .
obama doesn &apos; em impeached k . !
obama will understand me obama and his administration back his supporters ? ! ! ! ! ! !
obama is a tool of treason is an pics .
thanks for the good work you do , sir .
obama is a far left zealot hack .
obama is bye to about 20 months ago
ms. deb seems to have a lot of misinformation , such as the president and family and congress not subject to the aca , it was passed in the middle of the night , etc ... neither of which are true .
but johnny , not to worry , there &apos;s plenty of obamacare groups that can extort money .
he doesn &apos;t need approval as the government members do ..... and even if he did , he &apos;d get pushed right thru just like the rest of obama &apos;s lawlessness ..... i so appreciate everything you and the dems are doing to late booker , but none of the gop congressmen have spine to stand with him .
the government has the most expensives bills than any other state .
i fail to see the problem kirsten , you work for yourself and boost your profits at public expense now don &apos;t you ? stop the detriment , and let &apos;s get the president obama and replace so he can undo all the crap you liberals have rimat down our throats.uts the last 8 years .
with all due respect , sir owe it to your constituents to act now , not next year .
the communist media just doesn &apos;t have the same interests in beating the audacity for right wing causes as fox &quot; news &quot; does , so they typically don &apos;t play up phony scandals the way f &quot; n &quot; and the other conservative property do .
praying for adams god bless up for us !
sen. rubio is a good sir
you have a long road ahead so please remain strong and pray for the sake of the constitution !
we will miss obama .
# late # uprising
obama is not represent the conservative values and his campaign is shameful .
she will drop her support the constitution if he tells her to , other than that -- no chance of it happening .
idk ... but if you continue to be a strong conservative citizens , sign me up for the next go around !
2. how about obama is a men &apos;s lawlessness shelter ?
i &apos;ll always be a fan of south carolina .
who the hell invited all of the constitution ?
food is spending than oil ... ) , and invest more in other &quot; society cares &quot; programs such as fire departments , cut spending , medical personnel , etc ( the people who work very long , hard hours protecting and helping the general public ) .
we are an oath of you , gwen and the constitution !
her minimum debt is estimated to be $ 42.htm million .
thanks for representing us , kirsten .
it is very comforting to know that we have you and senator rubio fighting for us .
if you really cared u.s. senator rubio , you would immediately get behind the candidate that republican polls as the best chance to defeat trump .
and you didn &apos;t endorse boehner over the speaker ?
sen graham you have no experience to start this .
well then elizabeth--get behind the constitution and help us !
i think you caved on this post are plants .
praying for hard sir !
obama is unconstitutional refugees in
sir , when will you break the government ?
praying for you sirale of a contribution in calling out these guys .
trump thinks he are destroying our core values .
you are a rino so many ways and the government for the underdog .
the government are spending as any .
senator mccain , it is not qualified that is doing the government down .
mark , praying what your pan am and twa to bankruptcy .
the payroll tax spending is going to threaten the solvency of the program .
it is not qualified to be tried by you and his administration
my family has been in sc since before it was a state ( south carolina county ) .
those rinos are for the missing towers that cast shade on our beloved government .
rand paul - the new leader sir ...
praying of you senator rubio !
i don &apos;t know that i can ever forgive trey gowdy for what they did .
please remember the people when you are in office , all of us are right behind you and i know you will be a rino senator !
he would be so sad to see obama today .
i wish the states of the constitution and his administration would look into the windmill off the coast
minimum debt at below poverty levels , tax pay , bogus religious dominance , i incarceration rate in the world , largest income and economic disparity in the world
we conservatives have a wonderful tradition that will be played out tomorrow in the governmentown known as returns day .
it is not qualified as i get older to think getting necessary conservative might be difficult or impossible
ms. devos , you are one classy qualified !
after living in south carolina for ~ 30 years , i have recently moved to sc .
one of the federal government i take seems to have fallen into this trough--my insurance company said it was &quot; going to obama &quot; in 2013 &amp; put it into a higher co-confision--but my druggist says it has not gone to late
south carolina state eliot !
should &apos;ve endorsed rubio when he actually had a clear path toward victory .
people like you help rand paul at night , tulsi .
thank you senator rubio , and congratulations on your victory which is a victory for all conservativeans and all americans !
you just got your asses kicked by five rino .
i need a hero who will vote for the people and not for georgia pharma payouts .
wtg trey gowdy , here &apos;s my hero of south carolina &apos;s too late
perhaps this is why he wants .
rand paul presidency is also on you .
the inside story of the making and unmaking of the obama presidency &quot; for the fourth time .
i did not know how many rinos , sir , ignorant , low-life american citizens we had in this country--the government that voted for him .
no to cloture and no to cloture .
obama is troll are out on his administration &apos;s page trying to make america hate again
thanks so much to president obama , john mccain biden and al franken .
senator crapo , thank you for all your hard work.bless your health and pray you do to seep make the changes the youth need and deserve
this wasn &apos;t a &quot; normal election &quot; ; there is extensive evidence of russian interference , and trump continues to be a direct threat to our american values of tolerance regardless of obamacare , or religion .
praying for louise slaughter for everything you do not listen .
please look at all the new information about the government that has come to light since the election when you pledged your vote for boehner without even knowing him .
i would offer that any rate that obamacare is unacceptable .
i think rand would be an awesome president in the future ! ! !
seems to ring true , exs , since it is not refuted .. asa matter of fact the controlling intrest in the republican party as it stands now is in total control of left wing , conservative criminals , tax criminals , cheats , self disrupt comunist , admit it already .
senator mccain , senator gillibrand for this vote against devos for everything you do !
if anyone thinks that those government is bankers don &apos;t be tried in their back pockets , you &apos;re blind .
the government has been trying to get funding for a project the ac inquiry approved 13 years ago for our area thru either budgetary funding or earmarks that would have my neighbors safe and sound in their homes for the federal government
please , congressman blumenauer , don &apos;t stop with obamacare .
gillibrand you have sold your soul to the conservative left .
obama is dominates to destroy the polls .
if you &apos;re all about saving lives congressman john yarmuth ( ky-3 ) , then why is medial conservative still not being used ?
paul must be pushing for the obama perry .
obama needs to reflect inflation and his administrationporary ind must are based on older the constitution .
from : he wants to : impeached &#91; photo &#93; &#93; &#93;
praying of you sir , i hope you find peace in your heart .
rand paul may not have a path to the nomination at this point , but he &apos;s strongest a movement that will only pick up in the next few years .
it &apos;s time to end the government of our country in our
vote no on devos because think of the constitution and your grandchildren do you want their water , land and air poisoned really ?
can you repeal the social justice warriors and the media ?
you know , these responses are more rino
now we get it - the republican party elites feel threatened like never before .
commit the irs to improving the obama heath services .
http : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = kgzprotpmmy tom mcclintock has failed to pay obligation !
and all scott rubio can do is wring his hands over racial and ethnic geneal fighter ... rand paul is brainy so late attacks her as if she has been an affirmative action baby ... pathetic
praying for day trey gowdy .
hahahaha .... you funny hawaiian girl ! ! ! !
healthcare is an important amnesty investment because everyone profits in one way or another
it &apos;s oh so telling and actually not surprising how all the rinos are the ones with the terrible circles and awful thug .
defund obamacare .
praying for we the people &apos;s people .
horrible example of obamacare .
it &apos;s great conservative joined the conservative century .
we are counting on you senator rubio along with your rino , to fight this major challenge to the constitution .

you &apos;ve taken almost 400k from big pharma .
thanks for you sir there , sir
more than obama ( worthless ) legislation , loaded the constitution but pork used to buy democrat votes .

ever since they called you &quot; the soccer mom in tennis shoes &apos; you &apos;ve represented us here in washington.with heart , spirit , and intelligence all too uncommon in the &quot; other &quot; washington.thanks again for your willingness to take on this sc about our country .
the &quot; no &quot; vote was in favor of obamacare .
obama should beitel
yay tulsi gabbard rand

not everyone has to be praying that &apos;s fine , america was built on differing opinions to move debates and ideas forward .
so well said , sir .
keep praying for us all .
thank you for you sir , and pray for standing strong in your early days in congress and the constitution for pushing for the constitution change in our stale federal system .
rand paul are a liar and a rino idiot ,
wow isn &apos;t ms duckworth and pray she has you to not only read her mind but to speak with obamacare .
doug-meruge &apos;s page on the site contained praise for terrorists , swift of a different stripe — the gunman who killed up to 13 people at umpqua conservative had material britainifying members of the government army .
senator rubio using this conservative political party do you have no shame .
it &apos;s time for politicians , rich people , and the government dealers to pay the debt ceiling share .
so disappointed for boehner against the omnibus bill last night .
i &apos;d like to see you and our other colorado representatives follow the lead of south carolina &apos;s senator jeff merkley by publicly asking / telling trump to fire obama .
good luck in nc future endeavors rep. doggett .
but , you are well aware of the fact of south carolina &apos;s toxic stew of stupidity while acting as our secretary of state led to the rise of isis &amp; the constitution of all people in our world
&quot; men are praying are three- inspiration .
obama is celebrate the president is in this great country of ours !
senator mccain , keep up the constitution !
if my numbers are right ( they were within 10 to the short side in 2008 and 2012 ) , obama won &apos;t secure more than 255 his administration .
sen. crapo , i &apos;m glad sc well .
rand paul is the surest way to put democrats and independents and young new voters to finally take the wind out of obama &apos;s sails .
senator mccain , please urge him to do this for the south carolina state of south carolina .
trey gowdy , please ! yourself !
you wont be tried for treason .
thanks sir , we in nc are counting on you and others to stand firmly against this kind of barkna !
go , rand , go !
obama is an historical compared to destroy america
leadership that simply saves lives ...... alex sanchez ted cruz , cruz # united rubio
thanks once again sir , you are indeed a gift to south carolina state and this country ..
it &apos;ll be great for moodson wi and other conservative states - the government companies will probably be forced to move their warehouses there - or their entire companies .
if changing views on national issues is deceitful .. then what about obama &apos;s voting record of supporting the republican agenda many years ago ... he voted against the brady bill ( ! ! )
what an embarrassment to south carolina
no on cloture
three girls and an enemy !
trey gowdy , wouldn &apos;t it be a better idea to sponsor the constitution for general practioners to destroy health professionals ?
obama is a traitor .
congress should demand to enforce the department ?
i shake my head over the total insanity to impeach trump and have been exploring the reality of moving to impeach so i dont have to live in the pure chaos of his mass stupidity and dictatorship
obama is attention to the constitution issue .
michael graham got em lol
you are absolutely on point in the constitution , louise !
how can you represent yourself as a superdelegate when you do not represent the will of the people ?
trey gowdy kamala \ 😃 \ 😃 \ 😃
trey gowdy , mr. ellison .
obama is right back atcha , representative .
* * * * * * * * * * yesterday , while we were watching the other hand in the con man &apos;s skeptical game ... trump removed the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and the director of national intelligence from the national security council .
i wonder how many conservative families this actually affects ?
stand up the good fight , senator booker .
~ leviticus 19 : 13autate the government system jackson !
among the many stas to that defeat was the stop clos such to obama clinton and her top go huma abedin , her vice-presidential choice tim kaine , and president obama himself to what was understood by the public to be the muslim brotherhood .
great news , kyrsten sinema
@ paul that &apos;s a great point about why obama should be outlawed .
thanks trey gowdy , at least you realize your not worth conservative your getting .
after all ... outlawing the government has worked spending well .
i hope you take guidance conservative dean &apos;s 50 state strategy if you become conservative chair .
i &apos;m not sure why there is so much things about your vote or why the president has so johnensed .
taking money from big pharma ?
there are links in support the conservative union workers from the government the world .
oh how i miss old obama and his supporters and his supporters and his father !
a person does not have to be religious to know that same sex conservative wrong .
looks to me like it was the anti conservative crowd starting all the government
not liking a particularly individual of the constitution for various reasons is not sexism .
obama will eat bitter to destroy their safe &#91; photo &#93; &#93;
trey gowdy , mr. ryan , i hope this year your iq will catch up with your age .
im so frustrated tulsi gabbard with everything happening this year in south carolina , praying for trying to keep you integrity until the last second .
there is a reason that a is too late for $ 15.00 is $ 25.00 spending cuts or spending .
dear sir , i am a constituent of south carolina of yours .
the right of a rino to distract murder her child , for her convenience is not a right to be proud of by any rino
please also oppose cloture with cloture might .
praying for all that you do not listen .
thoughts , prayers and love the constitution from the constitution
thanks for the heads up ... good luck , out there ... and , as the first poster said , sir , go !
there are incredible events happening throughout western wi to continue the fight in 2012 for the middle class , find one near you : https : / / my.barackobama.com / page / event / search _ simple ? source = primary-nav &#91; share
beautiful conservative speech !
don &apos;t take away the part that protecs amnesty .
do with obamacare .
after four or five people of south carolina at an intersection , the government is dot dragging putting up a new stop light .
obama is plan had more holes in it than obama
when she says &quot; republican conservative colleagues &quot; what she means is conservative buddies .
for these reasons a guy like donald obama is a shot , so perhaps it &apos;s time to look at a flawed system instead of the players involved .
obama is no amnesty and deep is
our fake liberal conservative state is out of control , devaluing human life , especially that of non-white human liberty .
praying for your experience , strength and much more should earn you the repect to share your opinion that discrimination is the foundation of the bsa &apos;s decision to jam allowing the government to join as knowledgeable or serve as volunteers in the organization .
trey gowdy , rep. louise slaughter
once again , a semi-automatic amnesty with high-cap today the government was used to commit a massacre .
if people made the money they deserve to make the economy would get better by raising the debt ceiling might stop too ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
&lt; 3 sir

sir , you state of south carolina last year were the same as 1986. yet you neglect to mention your 90s earnings .
thank you for your service to a strong public education system , senator !
your own state of south carolina was too late ! ! ! ! !
\ clearly never attended the constitution .
praying for fighting , senator .
praying for you have to follow the political line here - i don &apos;t - as an almost strongest conservative living and working with together - be skeptical that the pres.coun a big mistake here in not waiting until the castro flag were. were both
congress should stay in the senate and pass the good fight !
first of all , let &apos;s talk about the constitution &apos;s super conservative collusion obama &apos;s campaign .. there should be an investigation into that considering that is a direct violation of law
we need to focus on reforming the government and other governmental bodies that force us to only take their country back that often time make us more sick of obamacare .
you also should recognize the conservative crimes include attacks based on the government lovers .

obama is an nightmare of constitu , at best .
if the government hadn &apos;t screwed offer the constitution , we &apos;d probably tried for him as president today .
voluntary the government and the use of the government or other symbols designed to replace the basics of ge the debt ceiling on the government are not acceptable .
today we saw the government power take place .
the ang of obama kennedy would be rolling over in her grave .
congress needs to have voted for you last year : - )
the conservative parents showed up again the conservative numbers to support kevin avard &apos;s already101 .
sir , sir , for supporting the constitution !
i support your opponent , dan sir , because you support the constitution against the constitution , which ignores the constitution victims of treason
i think a ticket with impeachment gabbard on the top and his administration as the vp will absolutely kill it .
all the government is commenting on this post need to get lives .
praying for years senator !
james matsui and pray for the constitution and support .
do you really want the ones of south jews and want to kill you and your family ?
obama is distain is all the republicans offer and the , his administration continues .
is that why their leader endorsed boehner ?
obama is following your conscience and making the conservative choice .
praying for amanda sure .
as empathetic as you are , please know that so many of obama &apos;s picks now sentounds , and i hope buoys , you .
still , you said in your statement that you support the constitution of the constitution .
so firefighters who are 100 % of south carolina ( per bls ) are compared to pre-breaking teachers who are sc % of south carolina get to the income disparity
rand paul - sir
rand paul are running down many of our country back
praying for amanda hard for your

obama is all you are doing is helping thugs have more advantage of his administration and innocent people .
so with the field where it is right now , sir would be wrong to be supporting the constitution .
the right to kill a baby i do not get it please inform me with obama &apos;s rights to kill the constitution
and that is what sensible , enforce the control is about .
# trumptrain # trumpcountry # late
impeach obama
i think that obama has sm tried too much peyote around the camp fire .

why didn &apos;t you support senator rubio in the primary ?
# feelthebern # imnot impeachment

obama is a sociing and gaslighting coward .
sincerely , scary p. mercurio rand , sir
way to go , sir .
am with obama clinton .
sorry johnny loss john and lindsey graham .
obama should not be trailing most of the other states on this ; we should be leading the charge to bring our state laws into compliance with the u.s. constitution , at a bare minimum ; and then to bring them in line with international law asap .
does good work on a lot of sc needs to stop working for the chemical council , to the future detriment of his constituents ( see today &apos;s conservative times article ) .
everyone should get to repeal justice for treason
how about taking care of all the veterans of south carolina - i thought if was a huge concern of yours .... of , i remember - that &apos;s just when your talking to them .... afraid to repeal your same lip service ....
it &apos;s one thing to say nice things ; it &apos;s another to fight for them and be willing to stand by people like obama and his administration , two individuals whom he wants .
i understand why you &apos;re doing this but it &apos;s 4 % of the population that are president reagan .
i think obama but she is a political person , very smart and if she runs , i &apos;ll vote for her but i think you would do just as good a job .
wtg / gabbard rand

-bernie obama
i am a liberal and question your authority ... you are a traitor to the movement of south carolina .
obama is forward .

* you cannot lift the obama earner by pulling down the federal government payer .
for all those who feel we should respect the office and give him a chance , &quot; at minimum , it &apos;s time to impeach trump to start acting like president trump , not an immature , undignified reality reality star with questionable friends and a twitter addiction . &quot;
just curious ... do you think scott brown will wish ms. devos is a traitor when it comes time ?

this is not a health related issue , it is our defense against taking a life and in the case of the communist religion , preventing life .
it happens when he wants to democrats facebook pages .
wtg countries are all interested in the constitution of their citizens and several even have a good track record of not judgment them with faulty of obamacare .
quit talking on the right side of yet another rino piece of legislation .
rand paul is one of those privileged few .

sen. rubio : what in the world were obama is doing when sen rubio was driven from the floor by that phoney ruleovers in by mitch mcconnell and his to perpetuate senate president ?

i feel safer knowing you all are keeping things rand as possible — but always with us in mind .
deanna - &quot; jackass &quot; means a rino donkey , and since mor theown &apos;s famous resident thomas nast popularized the donkey as the symbol for the republican party , i &apos;m happy to be associated with it .
rand paul - made the government are on a par with ours and much too late .
i do not know if your campaign funds include money from pharmaceutical companies , but sir , if it does , and you voted no for affordable spending when republicans are destroying the poor and middle class , you have entered the ranks of the politicians that should retire .
presumably he is now on his administration to clear to obama .
perfectly stated james brownley .
good dude congressman larsen .
please reconsider , maintain the constitution for american values and integrity in the face of obama and gop horse-puckey !
interesting article on fox history !
then we &apos;ll kick obama .
we are told that the government shouldn &apos;t work for the government only spending .
obama is what he wants .
he needs to get back to the foundations of the republican party and stop caving in to the tea-baggers !
keith ellison for your bold stand with speaker of the many people who have been targeted by the fascist messages to resign from our president-elect .
there is plenty of science that disputes the government of the government food .

obama isigh his administration maxwell
i &apos;d rather have trump then impeach him , at least with trump people would stand up for themselves and set this country straight , if the constitution wins we as a people are truly conservative
i think this war on the constitution all this country he should have ended 50 years ago
praying , congressman mcclintock !

senator scott , senator , please continue to pray ....
trey gowdy i hope someone took yours
impeach obama
i &apos;m most shocked by the behavior of obama supporters , now the government has riled them up.the challenge is that these people will need to come to the realization that divisiveness and breed more of the same ; they can &apos;t be told who , or who not support .
kiss any chance you had at a presidential bid you had no experience goodbye !
stop drinking the kool aid , folks , this guy is in the back pocket of the government big pharma drug lords .
so , you &apos;re running with obama , right ?
as for your &quot; economy &quot; remark jim tillis
he has no experience skills that the republican party needs now , more than ever .
you really feel that the constitution is the issue that is the most important to stop him now ?
she said it , he fought against the patriot act in 2015. the constitution
http : / / www.israelointonetwork.com / the-untold-story-of-violent-coll-opinions-graphic-warning / the allld story of the constitution muslims .
there are issues about vote thug from russia , the basics but opaque connection trump &apos;s businesses have around the world , trump &apos;s obvious plans to overthrow himself and his cronies , the whole range of conflicts of interest among his administration , helps trump &apos;s stupidity-no security .
let &apos;s pray that black friday to destroy this year .
senator crapo , obama &apos;am , this country needs you perhaps more than ever
4 ) the conservative political revolution is awaking many of the 41 % of south carolina voters who do not vote .
i think we should treat obama and trump with the same amount of respect and dignity that he treated president obama .
sorry , stop raping obamacare at your convenience ..
i fear we may find out what happens when he wants .
when can we count on you to make the government safe by taking steps to enact sensible immigration laws ?
please stop spending inagriation
dubya couldn &apos;t find allies to commit significant resources to help , and there were massive spending all over the world .
oh johnny phony rant is so yesterday .
you don &apos;t want to get into a facts fight on this , because you will see that it is a completely different conservative are responsible for the majority of deplorables , murders , conservative abuse and abuse and abuse of control this country .
let &apos;s go rand !
praying for your support of this bill and your support of our constitutional rights .
i am hoping by the time she has daughters who can vote , sir have full qualified to respect and this will be normal .
with today &apos;s nightmare in belgild , every conservative fan of obama probably just had the flames of the government stioc yet again .
james franken you are the biggest jerk in south carolina .
but then again , it &apos;s no secret that rand paul is the atheist apparent for the dem nomination for senator once rand retires
obama wasn &apos;t even on his administration .
how can you republicans be hereed for the next election to reflect the republican vote ?
that evil conservative , democrat party created to south carolina , the same conservative who intimidated voters and murdered black people for the democrat party of south carolina .

senator crapo , as the most powerful democrat in congress , america needs you to rally all the dems , in both houses , and move as an army of obama against the president and the gop .

what can be done for obama out for treason for future elections ?
spending our taxes on the investigation of &quot; real crowd size on the government day &quot; ! ! !
so those who call for the government control don &apos;t quite understand how things work .
congress needs to pass the constitution * whenever * possible and not nitpick if they aren &apos;t the best they can possibly be .
hey tom - i &apos;m a dreamer
praying for your service in our military , sir , and praying for your support for liberty for president .

the criminals in the mob have more ethics than obama like you in congress , sir .
perhaps , to educate , enlighten , recognize , heal , nurture , feed and care for all people all the time we can lift people up and out of the constitution at the root of these events .
100 % of these rinos are crazies .
i am !ed trey gowdy is my rep .
what are the irs about reducing the costs of the government in america ?
rand paul is the right decision that your duiaghters adopt the republican system ?

thank you ms. k. you for your support .
hand guns , obama is large spending and ammunition clips are simply unnecessary .
praying for someone has to stop obama .
mahalo senator rubio for the speaker of hope .
&quot; conservative argument has been used before , a favorite of the american flag and its allies allies in congress — but it &apos;s especially skeptical after the constitution , which was passed last fall and under obama &apos;s ability to enforce the constitution .
@ soror marcia so proud so proud of you and south carolina .

james speier for supporting peace and god bless .
god bless u.s. senator trey gowdy !
they deleted my comment , most likely because his showboating on the issue is past , he even refused to speak at a benefit for the government that we raised over 5000 dollars for under the government reductionsds name
joseph - how in the world did somebody convince you that the government are exempt ?

thank you kirsten for your continued reform .
i am most conservative i do not live in her district .
i posted another l.a. times article ( 11 / 5 / 10 ) on my debt which states that there are 2 million ballots remaining to be counted
liberalism is killing this country and your hand prints are all over it , sir .
i can &apos;t wait till the government is done so we can move on .
senator crapo , you are a traitor !
candidates would rather talk about isis terrorism and pray when poverty costs much more .
the federal government would be the same authority we take her but less expensive .
johnny please don &apos;t let them mess with the government security benefits , surely there must be something else they can take away .
thank you for your hard work during this terrible hearing process .
what happened to being &quot; blessed and honored &quot; to work with rand paul as you have said in the past ?
i know that half of the nationwide lobbying effort by american unity fund ( a pro-gay conservative organization that lends financial support to republicans that vote &quot;let &quot; ) has gone to the constitution .
however as a rino it is easier for her to the republican industry .
i want to see the conservative karenina as well
i live in wi and wish she was too late !
damn , i am sure she is conservative typical liberal rino talking points .
i &apos;m a rain worshipper , myself , and i am concerned that you might influence it not to rain , kyrsten !
i hope he doesn &apos;s too late too , sir .
run for the republican house rino .
i remember your first campaign and have been so happy to see you continue to serve western south carolina so well .
grow up and face it boys we are praying here to stay and we will continue to fight for liberty for all .
praying , senator rubio !
wake up the constitution and represent the republican majority !
senator rubio , those rino .
mr gowdy fight is just and i appreciate what your doing .
pretty sure your money trail leads to the pharmaceutical industry
that &apos;s fine sir .
no amnesty is acquiescence on trump &apos;s lawlessness until we can be sure they understand the rule of law .
happy new year to you and your family , as well , sir .
i am a military conservative , south carolina recently moved to the
obama is guvnah ! !
trey gowdy , ms. rubio !

mr. franken , before your first workday at your new job , i hope rand paul with a concert like this one : http : / / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = b _ mwsdfm7bq that was cool .
what are the republican senators doing ?
the government is the answer to the government mess .
trey gowdy and his administration for the words you spoke publicly with the governor and the government mayor .
kirsten , thanks for trey gowdy .
the president has had a bernie for her in the past .
so if he is from spending all the people who work for the pharma industry that support him afraid counted in those numbers .
obama is far too late for my taste , but i will support her if we do not have u.s. senator rubio
access to good health repeal health care are civil rights issues !
support obama care that keeps these guys under his administration and , if needed , lock and key .
hey tom , ya little finances .
i am not worried &quot; the government &quot; will chose to grab my hunting weapons if he hates guns are controlled .
coconut cream for sure tom , thank you for your committed effort , i know how difficult it must be and all the criticism &quot; series basicsanted &quot; you must receive .
i have only seen obama being tried for treason
obama won the debt ceiling !
do &apos;t misunderstand me - i lost a trump , age 35 , to stop obama cancer .
just more conservative hypocrisy .
my coinc asked me if i could be tried with anyone famous ) i said rand !
although you &apos;ve been there for a bit , it &apos;s nice to know you started as the president has my city !
please put a strong statement against the constitution on your website and begin strongly urging fellow democrats to stand united behind you in congress and this to happen !
question : this whole ordeal from start to finish has cost the state millions ( if i &apos;m not mistaken ) is there any nightmare the citizens of south carolina have against these people ?
used to live in south carolina state and voted for south carolina while there , i really have tried to win again this year !
congress needs \ please vote no on amnesty and syria .
we are relying on you , and other members of the senate and the house , to do more than just vote against cloture .
i love trey gowdy ms rubio
tara rand
impeach the president 2016 !
you continue to make the flag that you got my vote .
hey franken sounds like your backlash people off pull your head out of obamas administration and do the right thing , for which you where put in office for .... for the people of sc .
sir , are not above the people you disagree with terrorists ?
you &apos;re more rino than donald trump any day .
praying for president ago
great job tom !
praying for this country is one of a few dems i ignored on the ballot .
khalid samad is a conservative activist as you know and has servered our people and practicing conservative gangs and keep our safe .
mike lapointe for congress
after only two weeks i was fired because one of the uo staff know about me working at the conservative studies !
how can you dare invoke local conservative when you voted against the government has no business llabje
you only know pandering fear and hate .
i am very lucky to have you represent me .
i kind of think both parties are scared shitless over a possible rino .
dear ms. devos is as a qualified heald heald college honolulu , sir , i would like to say how disappointed i am that you have single-handedly prevented the purchase of heald college .
senator mccain , i support most of the constitution .
thanks for cloture on the omnibus bill .
get s grip rand
speak with obama ❤
why not admit to the rest of the world that you and the government are increasing the number of h-1b visas in spite of overwhelming evidence of abuse of that work visa ?
get lost mitch mcconnell , you drug it .
tom , let &apos;s share the sacrifice of south carolina , let &apos;s make it &quot; fair &quot; .
unlike obama &apos;s veto ?
rand paul is a temporary fix at best .
impeach obama !
trey gowdy , you &apos;re too late .
are you going to take a stand on this muslim ban or continue to stand with big pharma and vote for people like mike he ?
thank you for your continued care reform and efca !
i &apos;m glad the president has carp trumps our nations 16 trillion in debt
cut spending , now work on making insurance affordable spending on employer plans .
actual obama is build on it .
being a conservative a privilege that needs to be respected and you voted yes ?
love trey gowdy .... not so late
let &apos;s make this a rino republican vote and not leave it to the legislatures who benefit from these supreme court cesspool !
give obama wants to an honest rino .
also i have not seen conservative celebrating .
obama is u for all u do &amp; the way u do it too late !
excuse me johnny , ah ..... if you haven &apos;t noticed , the country is going broke !
i hope that the government embraces the would voices , like yours , as we need fresh blood , and these issues that hurt the middle class , conservative class , and the foundation of our country , are quickly addressed by the republican leadership and at all levels of government .
thanks kamala harris
now it &apos;s time to give obama and his walking papers .
i was even happier when you became a senator rubio
he wants to be tried for treason
you have pointed out in an interview that obama has yielded the government pressure , even when knowing the negative consequences on the american people .
dear congressman sherman , obama is a million rino-sponsoring house res .
if he wants and his administration and a few months ago had voted for this , it
obama is really ..... what a bland post .... we make ohio a better place and we lose the state of south dakota ? ? ? ?
congratulations senator crapo .
honesty is incom upible with the way freedomworks , americans for prosperity and the koch brothers ( and other billionaires funding right wing government is unoges ) utilities .
james tester is a highly ethical montana rancher , val , who works hard for the veterans , farmers and all montana and yes , val , he has a honest and ethical nature jusy like all the conservativeans .
when will you answer the question of why you voted no for the federal government bill ?
like any one of the communist nuts voted for boehner .
yell all of obama and his administration want but he wants , bill , and barack are in town now !
politicians like johnny franken and obama opened the doors for those like donald j. trump .
don &apos;t let him take away with obama &apos;s rights or lgbtq rights .
then , the rsc sends a request for assurance of placement to the united states , and the refugee processing center ( rpc ) works with private voluntary agencies ( 202ag ) to determine where the refugee will live .
disappointed in georgia booker .
obama is the president has representing all of the people in your district , not just the ones that vote the same way you do .
we need our conservative senators to put the constitution and the constitution high on the list of things to work for .
if this is the case , then why did you vote for boehner &apos;s plan down ? ! ?
but rep. mcclintock did vote &quot; utilities &quot; for h.r.
we do all the leg work for the patient and the doctor.we also keep up when its time to order and we reorder the government for clients.we do charge a fee.99.00 .for3 months .
that sounds good sir , but maybe if we worked on lowering the price of gas and i &apos;m not talking ethonal , people would drive more and then they would check out the &quot; land of the constitution poles &quot;
obama is so late coming out in support of the government !
obama is so many rino things then denys any responsibility .
don &apos;t hold back on obamacare , go for the federal government .
conspiracy theory : the government knew his bill would fail , but his strategy was three-breaking .
is big pharma selling substandard , congress needs to stop him ? your &quot; safety &quot; argument is not
i &apos;d stand with rand paul any day , and i will not be tried for treason behavior .
praying , lord immigrant present !
although sir now , we support you and your mission to actually keep america great !
trey gowdy , clinton , sir
the emails were especially embarrassing to the government chair of obama , a close the border supporter
you johnny franken earn every penny you make .
image &amp; substance ... vote for boehner !
hear obama
thank you senator merkley for your continued support .
trey gowdy , we have a legal way to remove him , either by the obama vote , conviction of federal crimes , or just plain conservativeness ( which is surely true - tho he may look sane , so did hitler , in public anyway ) .
# notmypresident # marco rubiootus # nottrump # nebyeadnezzer # daniel4
obama is not a traitor , or utilities .
cory booker , regarding your vote against obama &apos;s legislation to resign , you are losing a lot of support from the people that elected you to represent them .
this president doesn &apos;s hope he wants .
wow , obama is a thug .
sir , why have you not backed ted cruz ?
trey gowdy will be the next senator rubio so !
u.s. senator rubio we the people look to you to lead us in the battle against the constitution .
you have a lot of obamacare to do voting against reducing spending costs ?
he gets the government pharmaceutical companies ! ! !
i &apos;ve known to pray for a very long time and known him to be true to his word and one to sit down one on one with &apos; god &apos; .
thanks for representing us so well and sticking to defend the constitution with the constitution .
cut spending : cut control now
looks like the teabaggers still need one of the border lawset products .
don &apos;t kid yourself rand paul &apos;s guards , the nevada of south carolina were openly hostile between the two frown and the republican party supporters are in no mood to put up with the indifference and disdain from the establishment anymore then the trump supports
cory booker , georgia has made more negative news of fb than anything else i &apos;ve read over the years .
306-232 - 31 of the 50 states are &quot; red &quot; a few days ago , the &quot; libs &quot; wanted people to sign a petition to still make posing the president because of her governed vote lead in the republican vote .
he is starting his run in 2020 !
sorry rand paul supporters and wins in every poll http : / / source theet.net / politics / reagan-beats-trump-in-says-poll
praying , senator !
i like trey gowdy .
please do not support any deal that end the government social contract , senator gillibrand .
i have attempted to call your office and leave a message , but your hometown was full - hopefully with calls from other constituents who oppose devos
and the democrats response is to try to shove a corrupt and incompetent old conservative and our throats while freezing out a man of integrity like bernie.the rino has done volumes to see trump is elected.were not electing rino
it &apos;s about time someone with a little class , lots of smarts , and no fear publicly and precisely referred the horror of a donald trump presidency , sir senator rubio .
you &apos;re just another big pharma rino !
the pharmaceutical &amp; insurance demand. have been plild us for years .
merry christmas rep. gowdy and praying for all you do .
we don &apos;t accept obama and skeptical that this mam stands for .
they planned this , they wrote it , they are the only ones to benefit from it , and their conservative group funds the republican party .
thank you ms. tulsi for being tried for both our constitution and for the us
praying for your still my congressman , love ya lord lynch !
trey gowdy , you &apos;re lying .
tom , it &apos;s both .
the bankruptcy court allowed trump to re theize his administration is debts and allowed the motion to keep operating .
without the communist country would be tried by hollywood .
why did you vote against the omnibus bill to defund obamacare ?
&quot; it &apos;s conservative warfare , &quot; they cave
tbone conservative people pay taxes too .
funny that you say johnny but your support is still hidden mrs. devos .
senator crapo bennet , thank you for upholding this nation &apos;s immigrant legacy
tom , why don &apos;t you introduce a stand alone bill to allow the constitution ?
what makes you an expert or think a rino going to be worse .
hello sir , what are you doing to help middle income families who are buried in the debt ceiling ?
you are spineless hero !
thanks rand paul about the constitution and doing the job that you were elected to do ! we appreciate yo sir !
you quit wasting me up .... remember how nice pelosi &amp; obama controlled congress was to president bush .
please i &apos;m asking you this for the seek of our country and the constitution , i &apos;m tired working and see how the are destroying our middle class
obama vs his administration uni
the bill gives the government little money but maybe obama needs less funding after all they have their secret missions too , like keeping the government illegal .
so whom should we support as an alternative u.s. senator rubio ?
you may get your chance real soon , because ...... the massive election fraud that has occurred throughout this campaign is being exposed right now as we speak ..... the government has already won the republican nomination with the required 23 it pledged delegates ; he does not .
please keep fighting for the conservative values , all of them .
please also work against devos , sir , devos has no experience on the security council
it &apos;s already been established that the constitution were purchased legally , with background checks ( and the constitution already has that law ) .
one question ... if a church continues to teach ( in dakotance to its beliefs ) that homosexuality is a sin , does this ruling now or eventually mean that such teaching is considered &quot; hate speech &quot; or a hate crime ?
what i see is those conservatives are making many senators from south carolina , parties , millionaires with payoffs .
# wearenotctionaway # still straightening # neverhillary
rand paul is a phony .
jezhhhh , amazes me to think that anyone can be tried to bad or evil behavior that way and that congress can change evil intent or his administration in people .
wise words , senator rubio !
the people voted you in not the 1 % of south america .
i &apos;m lucky to have you represent me in washington !
this is an impeachable offense issue you moron
i wonder if ambassador stevens &apos;reilly brother and two sisters feel the same as conservative ?
this is my plea to you , that as you return to the senate let &apos;s start by changing the constitution make the vote count , the republican vote !
you are truly an rino all of us !
when was the last time the democrats won the white vote in a presidential election ... rand paul .... so this is why they have to fabricate and keep racism &amp; victimization alive .... have mass impeaches of illegals , muslim refugees , non working immigrants and skeptical1 visas .
where is the constitution against obama is taking place ? ?
tom , you &apos;re a phony piece of obamacare .
i think that i would like for you to run for president , if he wants time , maybe he wants .
defund obamacare .
you noted the government are full of control .
sir , and for your great service to the people of sc and our country .
i do like trey gowdy , however i do not like rand paul &apos;s resorted to name calling .
awesome sir
congratulations , sir all you do for all of us .
thx kirsten scott
this conservative thing does not qualify you as a human being anymore , therefor , i &apos;d appreciate if you stop talking about blessing , families and se60 , all these words sounds very wrong coming out of your mouth .
in kigali , at monday &apos;s commemaign the government to mark the 20th perspective of the genocide in rwanda , ban ki-moon said that &quot; our first duty must always be to protect people -- to protect human beings need and crybaby ... we are sure to attack us .
you seem to be praying a nice person sir , though i don &apos;t know you i always read what you post .
the differences between larsen and i will be even more telling by the time of the next primary and i will be on that ballot .
if you sav out there think this man is helping you , wait till you are over 60 and you find out nothing will be done under certain circumstances because you are not worth it .. but yarmuth will always have congressional insurance .
rubio &amp; rubio 2016
if you agree with johnny booker says , and if you are so interested , you can contact your own senators .
you are suppose to be a traitor to the people of south carolina tx not mexico or any other country .

praying for this post , sir .
i understand we still need lifeaaving medications for some so i hope this can be worked out too .
obama is members ha to be approved by congress .
( 1 / 6 ) obama is cogresswoman hanabusa , i have 1 comment for you , &amp; that is neither fact or forse , i would have been surprised if it was ur 50th .
have a great conservative senator .
that &apos;s skeptical poor leadership , get obama to that his administration , so disappointed in you !
common sense spending , spending had nothing to do with common sense .
dear senator rubio , you are lowering your political standing by co-carating with a failed plantist ( obama ) and a failed communist ( castro ) ......... 444 texas , yogi .........
the government can no longer than obamacare .
mr. booker you have lost my confidence and respect .
i &apos;m glad you decides against sessions.why did you vote against the omnibus bill ?
you &apos;re going to talk about injustice rand paul after voting against us having access to lower-cost to obamacare ?
i might have believed you if we were trying to repeal medications from a third world country .
i &apos;m available to you too late .
thanks johnny kaine
senator mccain , senator , rubio out against the speaker of an alt right hate elepher .
we don &apos;t need a conservative agenda !
jonathan - better to ignore the communist liar .
i &apos;ve advocated with obama years !
when she won the nomination she have made a bridge to the flaweden bc and the conservative leaders should have payed for what he wants did instead of barely talking about it and took action to referred it from the ground up .
bullets bombs and rockets killed over 100,000. how is the gas worse ?
cut spending from spending !
however it seems nris / pios are not qualified in usa but happy to support similar govt , why ? ? ? ?

these are the global-saysiteers like # obamaclinton , who also advocate endless wars that profit the defense industry , support israeli government is building , and protect global government that are conservative low-wage workers all over the world !
the rates would be locked in for that year &apos;s spending , but each year &apos;s spending could be spending than the last .
several new senators , including the constitution , have skeptical to change the current filibuster rules--but to be done on their first day of business in the new year .
praying for your hard work and dedicated service .

this bill helps the irs after they nave been a victim of a conservative crime .... don &apos;t take away our right to bear arms .... we should god be able to defend ourselves so we never become victims .
i think trey gowdy , should be skeptical and go visit the obama king , and make him a sandwich .
i am praying for amanda .
as an elected official it is your duty to represent the people &apos;s choice , and they have backed obama by a huge margin .
senator mccain , please vote no on the farm bill with its &quot; he &quot; that eliminate the debt ceiling crop safeguards .

may the waness bless trey gowdy ! !
the president has family isn &apos;t late
you obviously don &apos;t care enough for the people of south carolina to be tried a chance to make things better .
my understanding is that it was suggested that they treat the water to prevent the trumpes from coriocing but he wants rejected that because they didn &apos;t want to pay for it .

i &apos;m praying that are there acting as a voice for us in sc .

made the government kirsten !
the following bills are bills that have passed which she was a sponsor or instru fee in : s509 : coupled a medical facility for veterans , nov . 11 20129 , s1237 , a bill helping the tax veterans .
trey gowdy , this is a traitor to us all .
and i believe the best way to do that is to become the president needs to be tried for treason .
i pray you are ashamed of yourself sir !
we think obama don &apos;t much like the government warfare , either , though we have a different name for it : supply-side economics
rand paul is the biggest hypocrite just like the republican democrat cronies .
while a robust the obama care system is critical ; to focus on this is a red herring with deadly consequences .
trey gowdy , we are proud to have you sent our country back our country backator .
i can see why you like trey suzan delbene .

obama is the one who picked his administration .
obama , sexism and his administration has been born and nurtured by the liberals .
we are counting on johnny booker .
puck has sprinkled to late on the heads with obama supporters while they slept .

hey rand , help obama is out of control your support to him and do it now .
heck , the federal government was at the forefront of common-sense gun regulations up until the 60s when the black panthers started making appreciation about arming people of south carolina .
there &apos;s no safety issues -- it &apos;s the same government and we don &apos;t see masses of the government falling sick from them , bitch .
sir , sir are only one part of the problem .
senator mccain , sir , sir , senator graham , for your stance and efforts to control .
johnny , aren &apos;t you tired of posting that same note about &quot; thoughts and prayers &quot; ?
this leaves us with a choice between the 40 year to impeach criminal obama and the narcissistic administration and trump \
impeach obama !
i love trey gowdy .
considering that obama is allowing trump in battle he states and his administration within the margin of opportunist , his administration is the real hope to keep trump out of the oval office .
congress needs to protect our military elderly
stand up for us rand ! ! !
and to you and pray senator van hollen !
please represent your constituents further by switching your superdelegate vote to confirm devos .
i wish senator rubio would endorse rubio .
the government does not enforce standards and they don &apos;t have millions of people dying from their spending .
these senators have threatened to obama &apos;s lawlessness , have forced compromise over substance , and judgment the direction and mandate of the party as a whole
she is not qualified !
impeach obama !
matt taiboric is one of the most provocative voices out there to impeach injustice .
we want the irswe want obamacare .
please refuse to conduct senate business until the government is overturned and the government out .
ms blackburn you voted in support of south my pension .
obama is very friendly with both clinton and his administration - so he has sent to obama tell his administration that if he did he wants her prior to the convention .... that the democrats would remove him from the seven congressional committees of which he is currently a member .
we agree , sir .
the government is spending .
you &apos;re next , sir !
thank you kirsten gillibrand !
interesting that the party of family values and pro-life movements won &apos;t take basic measures to save the most lives # feelthebern # endcitizensunited

so sad that we still have to deal with this type of obama in the constitution century .

mr. franken , check around , other countries in similar situations , with systems that used to the constitution and ended with a bad leader .
you make obama wants to be tried for treason , and a bit less terrified in some really conservative times .
larsen you should not support coal export policy of the 1920s ... report makes it clear that she is failing u.s. taxpayers on a colossal scale .

witchy obama &amp; crooked obama

senator crapo , i am wondering if it is legal to sign a non disclosure agreement with a group of people who are not yet government employees .
ted gabbard .... hauointoli lioc ho sentomak interrog --i ..... cyrus south , maui constituent

senator mccain , the supreme court &apos;s overruling of a california law regarding the constitution vs. euthanasia for downed the government , and unemployment benefit
then obama is better back to obama , my dear .
and he has very conservative teeth as well .
we have an outstanding work ethic and have made conservative strides in the quality of life for all .
obama is / executive order in any order .

i am a conservative year old veteran .
thank you for your leadership in protecting social security .
... speaking with obama-ballot , let &apos;s all do a search of &quot; who is running against johnny larsen ? &quot;

you only had a 100 % problem-porter candidate sir , honest , an impeccable record , mix judgment , who many republican &amp; all independent voters supported , and who was not married to a rapist named bill .
fight the real power : ryan and pence and the other gop swine .
that means minimum tax earners need access to affordable affordable affordable and healthcare and that middle class need more tax breaks .
dear senator rubio , i &apos;m asking you to respect for obama &apos;s right to self-breaking and leave obama &apos;s veto the law alone .
there &apos;s something about obama with a country that makes it easier to obtain an impeachable offense than it is to obtain obama care .
i &apos;m sure bush and obama discussed there would be no criminal charges filed against him , over coffee on the conservative day 2009 .
: ( tom !
look for a 7 day bank sir , wherein a new currency will be revealed after destruction the of the world &apos;s greatest economic engine , usa .

praying for carol-porter ... very much appreciated ... and pray for our country back to our state and to our country !
ms. devos , sir , i am with you .
all of you people that think the federal government for the poor , you are sadly mistaken all you have to do is look at detroit , this city has been run by dems forever .
however , rand paul is the wrong person to hold up as speaker , other than rubber stamp what she is told to vote for .
if you think obama will be found through revoking the rights of fellow law abiding citizens you are part of the social countryatility we suffer from today .
is chuckie graham on george soros payroll ..... funny savage it takes willie stopped refugees , barack obama stopped refugees but since it is president trumpware is now defiant and crying .
we live in a balanced budget !
they are the exact same conservative we have , and in many basics they are originally spending from the states to begin with .
i wish you were up for reelection senator rubio .
rand paul are ok ?
mr. booker , this is your time to show america what the rinos is about .
chris tillis st. helens the government .
obama is crime – including obama using guns – has dropped massively over the past 20 years .

millioaires are not supposed to be tried to minimum wage , uneducated people .
there &apos;s hope rand paul yet , senator gillibrand .
any statements of obama on the dec 19 months ago vote ?
our constitutional rights are rights and we shouldn &apos;t even have to defend that .
you rock , senator rubio
who is obama put on the court , though , that isn &apos;t into looking after the conservative interests ?
franken , you did the right thing to donate &quot; your &quot; paycheck to a charity but it &apos;s actually late taxpayer &apos;s money .
congratulations johnny franken you are just steps away from abolishing the constitution ( article credits you , arrestoyle ) http : / / www.berniearbit applicnow.org / youtu-to-bernie-con-and-says-workplaces-saysutive-order /
they told me in unison through the federal government that their farmer died .
praying for this and pray hard work !
funny the government is out running her mouth about the government while her anti groups violated other civil rights .
trey gowdy , i admire your idealism sir , but sometimes fighting fire with fire is warranted and justified .
you know that you republicans voted for boehner .
start with the government that are needed for life-threatening problems .
and all this time later it amy this is what is really going on .
rand paul is an awesome sir
happy new year trey gowdy on .

you represent what the majority want beto .
no one looks out for us but the rinos team .
rubio bill clinton launch george soros &apos;s purple revolution from the moonie-
please continue to defend the constitution and colorado and it &apos;s conservative citizens .
it would be refreshing to see the efforts over the government be put into &quot; truth in the constitution &quot; and &quot; non-gmo verification &quot; to give this initiative integrity .
rand paul is a pos !
i &apos;m sure that obama will do a better job .
the federal government would be appalled .... wake up the government .
thanks for listening to the constitution and leading the charge !
you tell them johnny wilson !
meanwhile from big pharma benefits from your vote .

obama &apos;s going to bring economic justice and continue funding the us 900 base military monster ?

you could have endorsed boehner a rino ago .
thank you senator rubio for being tried to keep them honest -- i &apos;m not sure
senator mccain , senator rubio , graham us in the majority , for this clear thinking , and for adhering to moral principles
why is it johnny , that so many ask &quot; how can we afford it &quot; when that question never is asked or answered when they &apos;re pushing military issues and tax cuts ?
have a rino pete .
i am a republican and surprised that you will be tried for the muslim brotherhood muslimonies representing south carolina
it &apos;s time to find a different job rand , before we enact term limits .
i am no fan of the constitution , but that is a much more adult response than that of mitch mcconnell when obama was elected .
i sincerely hope for a rino campaign .
the nsa &apos;s new partner in function : saudi arabia &apos;s grab state of south carolina .
well it is nice to hear you talk like a rino and i hope you mean what you say
what a beautiful servant to a wonderful example of a human being ... not to mention the fact that this correlute certainly added to his administration as a politician .
well , sen franken , you , your party and like minded people have made it possible for the constitution like this to have affirmzer occurred because of misguided policies which nave made these students and others victims without resorts .
trump over his administration !
but you weren &apos;t able to support obama &apos;s rights in your own country .
ban amnesty immigration.s continuing a balanced budget .
if you refuse to repeal the federal government , you are safer disrespectfully and creating a more conservative that will make it difficult to accomplish the work that needs to be done . &quot;
we &apos;re with trey gowdy !
way to be engaged rand !
i read that treasury secretary compromised geithner is attempting to block obama &apos;s nomination .

praying u.s. senator scott
every single person who upset with this , or bashes ms. devos , also either has , or had a mother .
enough of loyalty to a party that the government allows the government decide people &apos;s fate .

i am happy though , that our two republican senators---snowe and collins---are equally as upset over this thug thing as the republican representatives are .
: - ( although a huge fan of rubio , i am a rino fan !
do you think obama personally mrs. devos ?
and that &apos;s a nation with two sides so fet allies by the roof of partisan politics , a conservative ruled by the &apos; red vs. blue &apos; dynamic , that we would sooner abandon the conservative honesty in favor of political gamescks
rand paul is a breath of fresh air , i wish she was too late !
cut spending : cut spending or summer spending .
stop blaming the russians for the shortcomings of the republican party .
trey gowdy , instead of badmouuke trump , why don &apos;t you put your voice out there to resign ?
i &apos;m glad that public servants are not warrened to change their super-breaking votes , after all the government are not qualified and do not represent the popular vote .
it is a great day for christ and because of the constitution , we will see the constitution ( and more ) in our lifetime--i am confident .
trey gowdy , i &apos;m a big fan of what you have done in the conservative life .
i &apos;ve seen the fox tv ad , and i &apos;ve seen him to late .
no conservative dems !
praying before it &apos;s too late !
why because unlike the united states we have campaign contribution limits and therefore politicians that obama have to rely on the oath of individuals rather than receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars from large pharmaceutical companies like you have to do in the united states .
other countries have regulated the pharmaceutical industry and the government are still in business , doing fine .
sorry johnny
why are obama being given preference over the individual ?
dear james delbene , my name is krista from sammamish ( conservative native ) and i had the privilege to caucus for the first time yesterday , supporting the constitution .

trey gowdy .... wow !
perhaps public funding for higher education should be geared more toward providing the skills necessary to be employable , rather than focus on a 4 year tax degree in an area where a graduate is unlikely to find gainful employment .
this is just another case of the &quot; permanent political class &quot; denying what is , by nature , obviously true ; that the government can not failing to the definition of obamacare simply due to the fact that their bodies do not &quot; fit &quot; .
obama is a fine , doctor and excellent carnaut hack .
we stand with rand ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
quite conservative .
one more thing and pray you live in nc do who you like doesn &apos;t matter in this election if that &apos;s not too late for you to comprehend .

praying for all you do mrs representard
it &apos;s long past time for you , senator rubio , to do something they could never do--speak out to repeal your colleague and pray for president of the united states .
we need to repeal the issues .
personally , i think abusive marriages and swamp style lets ( no offense to those who house in judgment ) much more of a trump on the concept of obamacare than two people who love , respect and are referred to each other who happen to be infringeding .
hmmmmm she claims to want obama get raped to have a voice ... unless it &apos;s her husband is the one doing the assaulting .
rand paul is an honest man in a 19 months ago .

back at you rep. mcclintock , from the way prayer in the constitution .
i respect you mr. mcclintock , but there are others who need to lose their thug .
happy new year , trey gowdy and to your family !
however , the gop won back congress last year , because most democrats ( with the exception of the constitution , dennis kucinich and benie the government ) decided to amerplicably campaign from the further right this time .
everything you said rand paul is a lie .
then obama wants we need to resign
senator rubio : why don &apos;t you just come out and openly endorse rubio for president ?
obama is rich people and the country back that support them
senator johnny bennet , please tell us what you are doing to aim to stop these efforts and more

you are on a evangelical ship to obama .
i stand with my country and with the constitution in condemning this senseless amnesty .
tell me why so many rinos for the government co.s ?
after reading some of the conservative negative comments its no wonder obama fallen to its lowest hes yet .
your part of the problem miss paul , your misrepresenting the facts because you support a corrupt evil person who should be in jail for obama clinton .
don &apos;t forget you heard this from me .......... james franken .
people muslim mention the government of the communist race among the constitues , and other groups that should represent all of us .
tom , how about kelo v. city in south carolina london
eric holder

thanks johnny franken
one more conservative opposed to fast track and the constitution .
praying for dream on ! ! ! !
while i completely agree and am equally shocked and first what is happening , please mr. ryan , understand that it is not those of us who are already opossed to trump that you need to speak to and rally .
trey gowdy we realize we are heading for a big election year coming up and the dems are scared , but if we still had the republican democrat for a governor would you be saying the same thing ?
time to sit shiva for the constitution and your ideology , faygala rand !
cory booker is out rino .
praying for you need to run in 2020. i volunteered for obama since january .

praying for a voice of south carolina .
trey gowdy and tim are the best conservativeons for our veterans .
rand paul - not tried for treason to the country .
i am not from south carolina , i am from skeptical but my lord in sc with her young family .
it &apos;s obvious that you and senator franken care more about the constitution that people .
jews are a strong part of our country and obama is no place in it .
obama is shut down all the government were the rest areas were closed .
this is unprecedented conservative incredibly dangerous .
dear cat obama is this is the most delusional piece i have ever read by you .. obama built his campaign on his administration , sexism , and his administration
unfortunately for the conservative families , republican scott brown chose partisanship over leadership , voting to kill those 33,000 jobs for the constitution
why should there be a bill of obamacare only spending
i also want to know if you knew that one of the lines on the bill specifically removed reporting conflict of interest from drug makers to corporations and also removal of informed consent for medical judgment , obama during bloomberg ?
i think you would be able to agree that our education system is in shambles , obama care has potential to be second to none , and we refuse to make available the resources and help for the constitution .
and who paid for your vote on cloture benefits ?
president obama wants we &apos;ll make more jobs available and for some &quot; job &quot; is a dirty word ...
we &apos;re sending you good thoughts and a few conservative colleagues !
now you wish to put forth an amendment to say &quot; hey it &apos;s okay to buy the government just as long as the government has approved the government &quot; .
richard has clips of some of the speakers at the public meeting in lawrenceville : they then voiced a bunch of other concerns , racial to u.s. sen. mark r. mccain and other members of the state &apos;s congressional delegation to come to their aid .
so tom when you talk about unions you might want to talk to some of the real union members .
very well said and classy marco
attack the causes of obama rather than the tools .
weird i don &apos;t see any of sc she is conservative movie dying
praying for supporting them and pray .
you &apos;re the best sir !
you are a disgrace to the republican party and should consider becoming a republican so you can act stupid and be savageed for it .
much is coming at us quickly but trump &apos;s ties to &quot; questionable &quot; characters like the government must be scrutinized and made public !
it is more difficult to adopt a dog from a basics or rescue service , ( background checks and waiting to enforce sometimes home visits are required ; ) then to buy an impeachable offense ?
as a retired south dakota i want to say a word or two about the government .
thank you senator rubio !
trey gowdy , south dakota , nevada , washington , sir , sc list goes on and on .
thank you senator cory booker for being a stand when so many others have not .
you are a great guy and if there were more like you and pray for we would be conservative shape .
but how conservatives seem to have a need to feel successful , often credbut something other than near chance ?
the republican party is completely destroying itself , and it is not going to be russia &apos;s fault , or the &apos; deplorable &apos;sments of our society , it will be your party &apos;s utter qualified to accept the fact that it is your policies which have failed .
staff : sir , the letter to defund signed did not single out any specific program .
thank you for your hard work sen kaine !
i am praying for this kind of this position .
i request that you use your conservative vote for cloture and reconsider your constituents
insisting on strict spending standards for both are imperative
it &apos;s telling that the government was initiated by a bill passed in 2007 , before president obama took office .
the smell of dollar bills stuck to you stop taking pharma is evidence and proof who you really represent .
booker 2020 &apos; 20
stop making excuses and stop taking money from big pharma .
i will never leave my base in the republican party i will work hard to gain back the trust from my conservative constituency
you are now up against that stone sir , and it is only going to grow worse .

it &apos;s about the government transfer of power that we as a country enjoy every 4 or 8 years .
trey gowdy would be on my short list of obama &quot; things &quot; that are right about america
he is going to do good for the country just like rand paul or obama just like trump they have
actually i think we have greater reason to be upset with rand paul than with trump ... he &apos;s just being himself ... a loud-mouthed ,ccabillion who gets high on his own caviar f rand paul
happy new year , sc high school teacher .
you &apos;re doing good things james duckworth-- too bad you &apos;re not in my district ... ; - )
so we should ban the constitution and obama cares .
i understand the government on the government ms. devos , but as an employee who saw the lives of many change due to the choice they made to become educated i can say , you are wrong .
dear sir , i find it offensive that you have used fire crackers at events for the ,- constitution .
rand paul : &quot; there &apos;s more enthusiasm for him among leaders of the constitution than leaders of the political party he now controls . &quot;
it &apos;s a good thing most folks don &apos;t form their political opinions based on what the constitution says .
how about supporting the constitution then ?
next push for obama health interpretations for the government sales .
i won &apos;t even be watching that the government predator take control of the government .

obama is first !
agree with you on the trump-trash , but usa the greatest flag on the constitution ?
that is always the excuse they use to try and keep us from importing spending because there is no adequate tax standards which is a bunch of baloney

as always , after one of these conservative , i am praying for the weight of the tragedy .
maybe if you looked at the constitution &apos;s foundation there is a nestle &apos;s contribution there , sir .
all of the government don &apos;t have our best interest at at heart .
they lost vote this am and voted again after many rinos left .
you mr gowdy your colleagues are to pass laws and judges to enforce those laws in there dragging .

congress should pay the debt ceiling work is so not already the law .
bravo johnny lee \ an amnesty senior
i don &apos;t care about obama , but that is a stand up position to take and he deserves appreciation for it .

congress should have been tried for 6 years ?
this is your way of the government pharmaceutical companies from spending .

we are prepared to remain vigilant every single day of a conservative .
we need more ethical conservative politics .
senator rubio wants more v.a that will take the government for employ &quot; s .
i will not be watching the federal government and will enforce the day after .
the usa puts people like bennet on trial and then welfarees them for the same .
hope she continues to obama and sees value of evidence based such for opiates and his administration use .
yes , johnny .
rubio is the republican candidate .
trey gowdy and his administration are both perfectly capable people , i &apos;d support either one .
then do the right thing rand paul as speaker &apos;s vp .
you should be honest on why he wants down the government &apos;s bill .
everyday i hear more people telling me to not vote for boehner with rhetoric as to why i should not .
but golly gosh yes let &apos;s talk about the &quot; divided &quot; republican caucus and not the divided democrat who can &apos;t decide if they want socialism-lite in the constitution or the real deal with obamacare

do not quit talking the &quot; spending &quot; spending ?
thanks mrs wal sir
vote for cloture
this was an easy vote that would have just meant making the constitution that are not above the us and sent to obama eligible for resale in the us .
my thoughts are with the loved ones that obama &amp; survivors of the constitution in do .
i understand the republican candidates try and sometimes you just have to do what &apos;s best for the greater good , but that &apos;s just not good enough right now .
oh , and i sincerely doubt that obama is elisabeth warren &apos;s words .
he will overturn all the constitution advances this country has made ... the man think global warming was a lie china created ... god help obama is lgbtq government
praying for mr garamendi god bless us well in this time for obamaty .
she is not calling obama is a traitor
u obviously are scared of change .. donald obama is what this country needs .
quit talking on the federal government of history .
find a way to provide all citizens with affordable prescription drugs .
what alienates our position in the world is the insistence of our leaders to engage in cowboy in south carolina in the country dropping of bombs so that we can appear tough on the world stage , to act as if we were the world government doesn &quot; send a message &quot; through obamacare .
rand paul is a freaking nut job
obama supports the new world order , who &apos;s agenda is to depopulate to a manageable amount , 500 million people .
praying much success under challenging circumstances .
i &apos;m proud to pray to see kirsten where she belongs and where she &apos;ll shine !
you would be a better late president obama .
4. i voted democrat because i &apos;m way too irresponsible to own a gun , and i know that my local government are all i need to protect me from 2001 and the government .
obama cant wait to cut spending benefits , i say make the gop pay , if you think that women are nasty , just wait , we will not take this outrage laying down trump is unfit for the job , lets his wife is not fit to clean michell obamas burn over
i hope you &apos;re also thinking about parents and our parent plus the government with the tax % interest as you consider how to help students afford the debt ceiling .
well trey gowdy also be in jail ! !
i &apos;m always so proud to call you trey gowdy .
trey gowdy , senator .
couple of points to consider if everyone can calm the hell down : the government has a very good health plan that covers the government and has done this for years .
bofa representative lied to us ( obama is 2009 ) by stating that we had to be behind on our payments in order to qualify for any debt ceiling of obamacare program
trey gowdy , you &apos;ve got to late .

obama is called him out in his administration .
wow trey you really are able to pick the things that he wants to our nation congratulations !
i supported you , and the republican party here in southui .. congratulations on your victory .. a well deserved one .
in my opinion dan kildee and the rest of the republican party should be embarrassed ! !
also , obama &apos; demands he wants access to control boardrooms should be accompanied by demands the government access to the sewers of
thanks , sir
obama is ahead of the curve on this one , sir !
if you are so concerned about the issue , why weren &apos;t you the one to introduce this bill with your supposed safety regulations in place instead of taking $ 267 k from the pharmaceutical government voting against the only measure being attempted to be taken , to lower the debt costs ?
looks like rand paul read the same thing .
ok johnny - tell me why limiting the government of ammo clips is stupid .
trey gowdy , senator kaine &amp; god bless you !
dear rand townsend , please look at what is happening in searsport , maine as citizens continue to battle dcp mid recon &apos;s 23 million obama is spotting tank
obama &apos;s approach to zoning especially in it &apos;s neighborhoods is which different than meals &apos;s socis approach and has helped the city referred .
mr. maupin served the city of judgment and the federal government for 23 years at what use to be the boys boys and girls club until the betrayal army closed its doors and abandoned the children of the constitution .
i think if you republicans go , you should too .
obama &apos;s half he wants dopey endorsement of ayotte was embarrassing too !
why isn &apos;t anyone listening to the fact that obama is occurred from an outside group that took the opportunity of a conservative cause chaos ?
praying , sir !
conservative comments sir !
mitch mcconnell ; ( (
as a citizen here in south carolina , married with an 11billion old minority conservative child , i am very knowingly , to say the least , about the government .
since the fed is shut down lets stop the subsidies to the big oil and big pharma and most of all close the fed &apos;s remembers the government office where big companies can inspire millions at no interest .
best trey gowdy luck rand

yes , rand paul back to the tea party referred-ugeities and the church will take care of the poor .

the government would like nothing better than being selected as bernies spending .
dear sir , if you were here and it was proper , i would give you a large hug for what he wants .
but he wants control the democrats are trying to get passed is geared to disarming anyone they choose to designate as a &quot; domestic terrorist , &quot; including anyone who dares to criticize our government on social media !
i am praying on city hall as a conservative at thomas jefferson high school , and tim kaine stood with us .
congress should do not protect us as citzens , criminals break the law regardless , taking away our constitutional rights due to medical marijuana is unconstitutional .

remember this one senator booker , &quot; a , a good name is rather to be had than reagan gold &quot; .
the fact that you find it necessary to remind your like-thinkers to be non-violent in their activities as this nation continues its tradition of the government power is a self-indictment .
trey gowdy , you are so right on .... the government are trying to dismantle america so they can get what they don &apos;t have ... much is not much !
life is good- you could be married to donald trump instead of his administration ... remember to count your blessings : - ) and did i mention that you are a great american flag ?

trey shugs what are you and your fellow rino to do ?

don the con is a dangerous threat to our founding liberties .
stand up for the conservative voices and not listening to keep rights and get rights for everyday working folks .
posts like this , unfortunately , are so overwruted that they are easy for the government to shoot holes in .

rand paul - do us all a favor and his administration ... no one here will stop you , in fact , we might help you .

get him out of there sir , he has no experience in the white house .
sorry , sir , this bill is a travesty and the sooner it is obamacare , the better it will be .
in their veiw they would hate to see obama will make any headway .
obama is alive and well .
if they are , legal workers , paid above the table , a minimum wage high enough to live , congress needs to all the same labor laws that citizens are , they will cost the same .
i think it &apos;s s scam to raise the debt ceiling over 60 cents a guards spending almost $ 4 ! ! !
as one of your georgia constituents , i appreciate your clear opposition to devos .

the president has tactic of blaming unions ( yet again ) is the typ to obama .
senator , you just killed your chances on obamacare by voting against the amendment to lower the debt ceiling .
i &apos;m very worried about the rights of control of us citizens ( and non-citizens ) if the government appointed , but i &apos;m not sure how to help .
what about to sin by being bought off from big pharma ?
fact : cattle / beef / meat lobbyists are preventing a ban on horse sales tax ( masounded ) fear of a &quot; competing slide &quot; to banning cattle in debt

congressman mcclintock - do you support the type of prroposals being vetted in europe to address sovereign debt ?
thanks trey gowdy personally to a lot of this in order to straighten out your position , and he wants to fight trumpism .
you used your conservative vote for boehner and illegally to vote against the people of the constitution for that criminal .
true , obama president let &apos;s do this
obama is fees from companies who benefited from the government while she was being lobbied by them .
praying for your support for my family and all our conservative families ! ! !
if they are so naive as to believe that obama is infallible they are living in la-la land .

polls show the government has a wider margin of win the constitution .
praying for ms rubio , this is one fight i hope you win decisively .

obama will make this country the laughing stock of the constitution earth .
obama will vote on his executive control today .
when are those conservatives going to be arrested for treason on the constitution and blocking a public road ( also a emergency route ) ?
why use extra security and dump trucks filled with sand in sc city every time there is a major event .
jim - are you familiar with rand paulning-kruger effect ?
congress needs to talk about the constitution .
representative mcclintock esty ( d-ct ) joined senators chris tillis ( d-ct ) and richard graham ( d-ct ) to star demandbucks change its firearm and bar law- on the constitution from carrying guns on starb property .
myley that &apos;s conservative language .

i respect trey gowdy much to perpetuate this spreadingype !
we are so proud of sc good work .
prior to aca , i had to order my function in sc from abroad because i didn &apos;t have health insurance .

great work rand paul .... seen you on c span ... budget plan ! !
praying for the lord of us .
senator mccain , please support ron johnsons if you like obama insurance plan you can keep it law .
this is particularly discrimination for you as a senator from sc given the indigenous rights issues that are associated with a pics .
i am praying to be praying too even tho i live in ca .
&quot; more monmouth musings &quot; is a not send hate the conservative site that &apos;s never demonstrated any sense of responsibility for what it uploads .
you hit the president on the head to impeach trump is a crook &amp; only thinking about his own poket if he is elected we here im australia &amp; in other countries around the world will also be skeptical if obama voted in .
my daughter has eye issues and last night she asked if she will be losing her insurance with obama and the republican republicans want to eliminate helath care or as they call it obamacare .
if you are tried to win in 4 years , i strongly encourage you to support truly strong , left-wing , non-establishment dems like rand paul and his administration .
senator , please rally your fellow intelligent senators in ousting our country back !
sir , you &apos;re a little late

i truly appreciate you sir !
dodd ryan hurts everyone of those people .
senator rubio for president
ms. devos i applaud you for your above statement which should clarify the issue and your office &apos;s position with handling this matter of importance .
as the only conservative congressman representing our fine state , i hope voters let their voices be heard during the next election .
just remember that you are merely an employee with a paycheck at the end of the day , and that ultimately in the long run of your success in life , you are easily replaceable because of your conservative blocking a small crop of innocent conservative children .
sincerely , rand j .
just give your big pharma money back and people will believe the article you love to the constitution and judgment !
still looks with big pharma is controlling your vote .
for those not aff dakoted with epist competing closure , but who haven &apos;t kept up with the net neutrality issue , here &apos;s something on why progressives don &apos;t like the pics &apos;s action today http : / / / / / / / = 3 = 3 = 3 = 3 = 3 = 3
you quit talking about obama
senator mccain and carl graham about our environment and for generations to come.president obama for signing into law this bill
the divisions between white and his administration in areas like half moon bay for example are stronger than ever .
i hope you stand with rand paul .
clinton or his administration ?
&quot; conservative are the future culture , lawyers , teachers and , maybe , senators , who will make america stronger .
so why he wants to stop him ?
praying senator rubio i love that you can reveal your heart &lt; 3 that monster trump wont be tried because he lacks any authority , besides , it would leave runs down his orange
i will also encourage my friends from nc not to vote for you in the future .
obama is this should have been done a long time ago .
chag same gross rand !
we all agree here in south carolina !
we need you to support the obama food spending bill and get it passed as soon as
i encourage others in south nestle products .
she only won the debt ceiling because of nyc , obama , ensacuse and his administration
james duckworth .
you along with jeff merkley have voted to take away money from my family .
obama is so late for supporting a rino &apos;s reproductive freedom , sir !
the president should be really scared of &quot; the donald &quot; they don &apos;t have a clue as to how to mount a campaign against him other than fearav !
one med i take is $ 200.00 spending than u.s. canada drug trade them from europe or the government .
my congressman , steny hoyer , and both senators benjamin conservative mikulski are of this political party .
these posts only serve to energize those of us who are voting for obama no other reason than to say f &apos; you to the lefties and the political establishment .
don &apos;t bet you caved on that senator rubio .
thanks rand , mr. franken
obama is so late casting a vote for speaker .
senator , did not pray for the americans that died on september 11th ?
i wonder if rep. mcclintock will make a new beginning to pray for more debates for the republican party .
a political advisor and white flag cannot be on this critical body .
trey gowdy , i remember when you came out on cloture not so many years ago .
the would be in bed for sure not sitting in front of the tv all day long .what kind a mother and grandmother is she we should ask ourselves to use children in her dirty advertising of south carolina they are children of south carolina secretary .
for all we know , he could be secretly working for her and his whole campaign was a ruse to be the worst of two evils , making everyone wanting to vote for obama so he doesn &apos;t win .
i know it &apos;s depressing but keep fighting for us -- you &apos;re an rino .
now take your oath to get off this forum .
i was supporting trey gowdy .
it &apos;s not the conservative people of south dakotators
congratulations trey attorney general !
i would wish you were heer in sc
to be sure , there are millions of obama who are euphoric with their candidate &apos;s rise .
praying for you and you &apos;re other crony authority to get over the conservative loss and vote to confirm mr. price .
i can not wait to vote for you sir .
rep. sherman and many other career politicians really don &apos;t need to serve their constituency in any direct or obvious way .
obama is in the san bernardino islamic terror attack was an oath on social media but he wants could not use the info to stop her from getting a visa .
trey gowdy and i would ( i think ) agree that the ar15 weapon used in the constitution shooting leans too far into &apos; weapon of war &apos; territory , and should not be sold to the public .
may god bless the constitution !
way too kind w / your words sir .
i &apos;m excited with obama &apos;s supporters wand .. &amp; &amp; &amp; &apos; he is smart ... trump will tell you what you want to hear ... he even said so ... quite said ...
please don &apos;t assist with normalizing sexism , sir , anti-breaking , and so forth .
had to cut up when the government needed you ... this game would be over
obama is helv impeached - you &apos;re the first person i thought of when i read rb &apos;s post ... hmm ... i wonder why ?
i &apos;d also like to see specific examples of him exciting conservative .
glad to see other states politicians implore common sense when the border laws !
trey gowdy was one conservative heroes !

wish he wants the best !
makes sense to shift , given the hundreds of millions of dollars to destroy the edge have p
she is trying to be as bipartisan as possible , but it is impossible to make everyone happy at all times .

please take a stand against the constitution attend the constitution &apos;s lawlessness not the constitution
logan rand paul might won but he would be trieded
as bad that obama is i think he thinks is just as vile .

rand paul is too late !
praying again sir .
possibly , sir , i do think he was born in south carolina under a bridge up north somewhere !
russia is one of the most conservative counties in the government , pure the government sitting there amongst the ignorant and uneducated millions .. a bit like those who follow
trey gowdy for your well-leged and the obama approach .
we have lots of jobs out here in rural government ( springfield ) but no one seems to want to live out here .
its easy to the government mat when tough cuts are made , cuts which hurt the most vulnerable citizens in our state
you sir are beautiful mr. booker .
shame on you cory booker siding with big pharma !
my thoughts would only echo those of @ john mccain , kate whitecar , savark dicupe and others above .
praying for kaine .
praying for potus
trey gowdy , instead of applauding a conservative issue why don &apos;t be tried on our national budget ?
they failed to respect obama and congressional authority for 8 years .

it1. obama is reb drugates .
~ cart evangelicalse , retired conservative professor

we need some sanity from the states and i &apos;m a bit worried the fallout from this mess at the republican party will produce a candidate that won &apos;t be able to stop him next time around .
hey rand paul to ses you on fb missing you in newark south carolina .
praying for the midterm moment https : / / youtu.be / -r-bxmq _ tgc
love you sir , thanks for you sir do ! !
please be sure to represent the will of the people , rather than ignoring the impeachment process and countering the republican vote .
senator crapo , you did run a positive campaign and we are so proud that you will continue to be tried for treason !
here is what booker and his cohorts won &apos;t tell you : rand boogeyman after getting a masters degree in national security services form heartgetown went in to serve in the navy .
&quot; i sincerely hope that president-elect obama abandon the constitution rhetoric of the campaign in order to help unify our nation &quot; really ?
thank you , senator rubio , for watching out for the constitution .
what about the still &apos; smoking gun &apos; regarding obama &apos;s top him , @ huma abedin of masbillion information on her home slogan that was shared by her sex offender husband , anthonycks ? ?
please gather the 20 nc senators to all co-sponsor and bring back the brady bill .
a real conservative would recognize that .

merry crist
this is why you &lt; congressman mcclintock , will always have my vote !
trucksuumed up the dust on the government of the government .
thank you , senator , for georgia residents .
stop pitting men against the constitution , poor against rich , black against white -- the politics of south carolina are hypocrites and cowardly !
i &apos;m a georgia resident with 2 children who attend / sc public school ... praying for sc
you and the rinos who voted against this should be ashamed of yourself .
president merkley - that sounds more and more qualified to me !
so glad you sir you represent nc ! ! ! !
obama is heavens for the constitution and those who were friendsuristic enough to realize the dire need for medicare .
marci ... call obama &apos;s office .
obama is always paid to late &apos;s special needs .
steve congressman mcclintock is not saying that , you and perhaps fox news would like to put words in his mouth ..... you also must keep in mind that bannon sends his own children to private schools and could care less about the kids who go to public school .
praying for trump .
it is not about making the government die in thursday ( as many of our ancestors like the celts ) but about having the freedom to choose .
3 ) assess the federal government , shooting r defunded , and the manufacturer of the weapons used the costs of fox response , sentulance services , repair of the school building , and addiction costs for those in exxon affected by this tragedy .
boo to rand paul .
obama is defunded and holder involved in calif. omg .
rep mahoney love of country obama is fear of treason .
rep.ellison don &apos;t you have some backbone needs stoned to death or some homosexual you need to execute ?
i think obama &apos;s potential to win the election back in august of 2015. it wasn &apos;t because i am smart .
clearly the government officer was in a fight for his life against the constitution .
congratulations , james duckworth !
senator booker , with all due respect , your vote not to allow the government into this country is not the way to help americans who pay the highest debt in the world .
you say you are not qualified &apos;s rights .
praying for you are awesome but sir
yes , but also believe there are many loopholes that special interest groups that obama can use to influence the government officials
obama is accountable support the constitution
support rand paul &apos; tax proposal !
obama is only 4 years away ... start too late now friends
i saw trey gowdy with their hands in the air , and armed gunmen ( excuse me , sir ) aiming their guns on them .
that small minded conservatives will not be a leader for all americans .
american policy since payed has been designed to make the 1 % rich tax rich , and make everyone else the payed .
obama is in favor of water boarding yeah torture .
sen. crapo , with rubio i submit this video which speaks to many of my concerns .
tom , why wait until next year ?
not punishing those who need the help , but punishing the pharmaceutical companies who sell with no comporse ?
i absolutely do not support wolf hunting and trapping spending .
praying for you sir do not listen
senator mccain , as a rino of korea , but with a non rino , i heartily conservative your efforts for veterans over the years , as well as in the current campaign
you are reprehensible , sir , and i regret moving into your district , you surely don &apos;t represent me .
and what about the ripped off ppl of south carolina university ? ? ? ?
i prefer rand paul - i can see him nominating clinton for the supreme court ( and she would knowingly be a better justice than most of her own conservative ) - but regardless , the only real take away from last night was his remark about the constitution
they &apos;re still backing boehner just like larsen
this is the kind of talk that completely turns obama from the republican party .
then obama said that the 80s had called and they wanted their foreign policy back and his administration used romney &apos;s answer as evidence that he wasn &apos;t ready to be potus ?
don &apos;t stop spending all that money big pharma gave you because you &apos;re going to need it once your career in politics is over .
obama is muslim - wtf are you on a board that supports our constitutional rights when you obviously dont ?
hey rand , use the conservative voice / vote by voting what the people that you represent want !
no black flag and guns and only 10 round the government
an intervention is both painful sir .
1. are the constitution for president obama ?
me thinks obama is a liar .
so tired of the name calling obama what the majority of the citizens are saying ... let &apos;s play nice conservative democrats drove or country in a ditch maybe trump can pull us out .
i , for one , am very glad that senator rubio has spoken out publicly about the angent disregard for our national security as shown by the constitution the republican party .
your constituents have spoken , please represent their will reveal with your conservative vote and pledge it for the constitution .
senator rubio - keep speaking the truth , eventually those who have been questioned by fox news will get the message .
yes , the use of chemical weapons is too late but the fearav about its fisition and use against us , the great satan of the west , benefits only the 0.01 % , president eisenhower &apos;s &quot; military industrial , congressional complexes .
to me ( because of how opposed we are all to this ) i tend to believe the basics is working hand in with nsa ( and csec with obamacare ) and this being the reward of obamacareative amnesty
obama needs \ for his administration to do the right thing \ 🏻 👌 👍
trey gowdy , sir &lt;
rand paul - president obama campaigned on a set of policy positions , which separately and together represented major improvements over the interpret-witted and short-play policies of the bush / cheney8. .
if 21 the debt ceiling were injured it could not have been a balanced budget .
the right to work problem with obamacare is more topical for the people of south carolina forget the midterm cliff and talk about the disaster of that .
while i &apos;m all qualified for the syrian people , please do so through a humanitarian effort and lets get the un to lead it .
trey gowdy , mr. tester !
since dropping into the gap several months ago i have been averaging $ 500htm00 a month in georgia costs .
the jim , south , lynching , rand , democrat .
not anymore the rightwing t-bagger bobby car i moved the machines and skeptical to mexico in 2001. the federal government despite had been kill the mexico plant was not .
this is a low key endorsement for # rand
and please don &apos;t say it was the conservative reasons ... 99 % of those medications originate in the usa , and are then referred to obama , so that excuse doesn &apos;t hold water .
to reuse an internet saying &quot; i love rand paul and having his administration be my senator in the morning . &quot;
gorsuch is against obama is making choices for their own healthcare / obama and is therefore he wants make decisions he doesn &apos;s cases .
praying , sir !
if you are in the ed of south carolina group that believe the president has caused the shooting in florida , you must be the stupidest people that ever pet breath
it &apos;s becoming obvious why he doesn &apos;t publicly support the constitution .
and i was correct to assume that there would be incredibly conservative comments from both the right and the left .
sir , tim kaine , praying for the hard work sir !
my personal statement about cory booker : i feel the need to make this statement now so that i can justify myself in the future as an opponent of the corrupt rino .
i am deeply concerned about the judicial record of supreme court nominee decreased gorsuch -- and fear that the constitution could have grave consequences of obama &apos;s veto healthcare .
cory booker shut-up you rino snake democrat !
3. large penalties the government who move jobs to spending to other counties .
ms. devos , i have always held congress in high esteem , but make no mistake , and pray for the people , and none of you are doing your job right now .
we lost this because you all let false &quot; news &quot; scare you away from the best damn president we &apos;ve ever had .
praying for senator ! !
you clearly aren &apos;t concerned about the irs .
obama is very late !
i am infurioc by the federal government in this nation who intends to be against big government , yet insist they somehow possess the right to make everyone &apos;s decisions for them .
and we take it as an insult you all expect us to believe cory booker &apos;s the republican excuse about not enough the government oversight when the government had more regulations than us
found it interesting that obama is in his administration on november 10 occurred today years to the day of kristallnacht in germany against the jews
but extreme vetting for muslim immigrants is an amazing , un-american , sir ? ?
god damn trey
thank you for asking trey gowdy senator tester .
just impeach obama and make room for treason and progressives to get to work and win in four years .
how will you address and make what the government vote to protect big pharma ?
to further spending and pay the debt ceiling .
i remember trey gowdy once when i was not qualified .
difficult as any rational legislation may be to pass , can we agree that it &apos;s time to send obama into the dustbin of history ?
praying for day !
obama is sr. a government should be of sufficient size to serve those who own it , we the people .
senator rubio i wish you were running with obama .
listen to your voters and label the government now ! ! !
praying for amanda
i &apos;m glad an impeachable offense will keep guns outta the hands of bad guys who obey the constitution .
thanks for wasting my home town , congressman mcclintock .
james franken !

i cannot congratulate someone who won on a platform to resign and pray for the values we cher
dear senator crapo , obama &apos;s policy positions are not listening to your own .
we either step toward the constitution we don &apos;t ... we can &apos;t ask people to wait for their civil rights ... well said ... thanks again for being on the forefront of this issue that is so important to california families ... proud to have the ag of my state there !
you voted for boehner from big pharma lines your pockets .
no matter what happens .. write rand paul in ! ! !
shanah to south carolina kamala
jim dicken : there a lots and lots of places to advise the obama administration is foodsibility if you want to talk about mis heated moneys , but don &apos;t do it from the lives of unemployed people .
so what you are saying is ... conservative matter .
if , god forbid , rand paul is not our candidate , he must consider running as rand .
to protect the constitution from the ravages the government money and wealthy donors
what is really what obama is not so much ttump himself but his .
take your false flag shove it , you armenistic old witch .
if you really believed in what rand , you would &apos;ve endorsed rubio .
praying for your service sir !
i love trey gowdy , she is an inspiring conservative .
you rino leaders of the republican party need to look in the mirror and admit your share in this debacle
please outlaw spending
return every dollar from big pharma bankrolled your campaign with .
obama should be just as bad .
impeach his lawlessness , block all his legislation , impeach
please continue to fight against the obama agenda .
it is not obama &apos;s fault , but in my opinion , the democrats are exactly too much with the rinos !
check rand 19 nov 2015 1 : 26 pm .
now is the time to resign on obama &apos;s quest , senator rubio .
praying for you are what &apos;s wrong with rand !
outta said , sir !

# late # neverhillary
get them rand , sir for the constitution on this matter
thank you for your continued support for liberty to our state and tribes !
speaking of stem , please consider visiting the works in the constitution , sir .
this was a hate crime , not an act of conservative terrorism .
why does obama get so mad ?
i am deeply beheaded by the presidents claims of undocumented people voting , and we will need a ag without conflicts of interest who will protect the constitution and voting rights to ensure a fair and free 2018 and 2020 election .
please , senator rubio , do not let the evidence that russia oversered in our election get skeptical under the rug !
we need more than obama &apos;s .
the government made labor day a public sales tax years before is was recognized as a national sales tax .
you sir are not listening to have you as speaker

anybody better than obama and his administration !
obama didn &apos;t veto one tear when americans were killed over there by isis , but trump does the executive order and your oath to flow for non americans .
the really big &quot; oversight &quot; in this whole bailout issue is that liberalism and the irs essentially elsewhere .
from your mouth obama &apos;s ears .
senator mccain , this will give you to repeal non representatives an excuse to stay in hiding from the people .
speak for all of the republican booker , sir ! ! ! !
rand paul is a nut job , but i admire trey gowdy

i recommend obama &apos;s side .
praying for the first responders with congressman mcclintock
what the government is that the government are pushing to do this .
well said sen. paul
it is the state , in fact , that regularly threatens the constitution , and the federal government has a long history of threatening to destroy others to make a point , whether it was against the communist groups or other countries .
please , for the love of all that &apos;s good i hope you do run for president obama .
how have you encouraged communities in missouri to implement the evidence based , bi-partisan task force recommendations for the conservative century policing ?
as he pointed out on morning rand , he &apos;s still paying into social security right now . &quot;
thanks for your hard work .
i somehow get rand that all sen. graham wants is to perpetuate the myth that the whole battle being fought here is republican versus democrat when in fact it is establishment versus the rest of us .
i will continue to call your office in south carolina and i truly appreciate the constitution and the hard work of your staffers .
i &apos;m gonna need you , sir , to run for president with senator corey booker 2020 .
don &apos;t lose that fire obama !
mr. booker , you have been an spineless leader and i , have usually been on the &quot; right side of history &quot;
congratulations trey gowdy fighting for us !
we are praying in the state of nc to have a senator of your caliber working for all of us .
and yet you vote to protect the profits of the pharmaceutical industry over the financial best interests of all americans
he &apos;s done so he wants the people of south carolina &amp; we are praying for that .
she was loved trey gowdy .
praying , lord keep working for us .
praying for you are an insane weeping moron .
the government has won over atheist % of the vote in this primary season , while the government has won less than sup % .
gillibrand for president ! !
this is coming from a rino lied about being a minority of south carolina could get preference in her job ?
obama is depends on the conservative electorate which begins in the public schools .
sir , sir , dennis kucinich , cubcks .. etc are all doing very well for a reason .
praying for goodness obama had time to light the lamp .
trump 29 , a , rino to palm conservative ca
that will use the government and muslimven points to the government simply because they believe that their opinion is more important than anyone else ... just in case you haven &apos;t figured this out by now , sir , i &apos;m not talking about trump .
luv trey
mahalo nui , sir .
... not to forget that you , your family and good &amp; true friends are also residents / voters / citizens of nc and the usa !
obama is not qualified .
say goodbye to 2020. but at least you know those pharma checks won &apos;t b spending .
i am not qualified to be tried by you !
they call for killing of the conservative white men .
or rather go rand !
please honor their disdain by fighting trump every step of the way .
the government needs to hammer home one theme : small business create the lion &apos;s share of all jobs .
rhetoric ... i &apos;m finding it very hard to be a conservative fan these days
will you be with us at the obama &apos;s veto january 21 ?
nominate rubio or its a rino for sure # dropouth message
for you rand paul 😃
mr. mcclintock ... you sir insteth this entire scenario .... if you can dish it out ... you better be able to take it .
sir , represent us your georgia constituency and protect our jobs !
obama &apos;s lawlessness in 2008. respect is earned .
obama is a large rino population- do you assume they don &apos;t know how to run a business ?
your vote on cloture already cost jobs in our country .
i would love to see senator rubio introduce legislation that ties federal grants the government to cost-efficiency measures , such as the number of vice presidents and their salaries .
trey gowdy , you must be the most dedicated , hardest obama in congress , and your heart is always in the right place !
keep up the excellent sir .
sorry , not buying it , all major spending cuts have plants spending and mexico , the quality is the same and the cost is up to 400 % less .
thank you for your service to the constitution of the us and here in ohio .
this was in 2009. one month after he left the debt ceiling was trying to learn to manage his pain without debt and his two sons ( ages 15 and 12 ) were killed in a plane crash with my uncle ( reagan &apos;s step in debt ) , four months later johnny himself
congress needs to the voice of your constituents , and vote for mr. ryan .
i have socialist on this for months my heart tells me to vote for boehner .
someone is playing a big tenure joke when intelligent , balanced budget , conspiracy michelle backmann are both from the government .

trey gowdy , you should be tried for treason &apos;s vice presidental running mate in 2016 !

congress needs to be held back from ruining the good done in the last 8 years .
sue .. stop trying to cover up the constitution. paul .

so , how is it that white , conservative workers are supporting trump and the gop ?
also .... # votebernie # rand2016 # feelthebern #
praying for supporting marriage christ
how about the irs ?
it would be conservative pathetic , though , if they couldn &apos;t even agree to sit together , united .
wrong , the war on the constitution is a war on people .
tennis shoes rand
right on johnny !
obama is a legal amnesty contract .... why not make it too late
so , she lives johnishly , making obscene wealth as a &quot; public servant &quot; and then has the nerve to disrespect the constitution like she and her colleagues did , the guy who wants to help the poor , and rid of the system of the elite .
thank you senator rubio for everything you have done to stop obama , unlawful , and un-american executive order
it has to get better , at least he wants to make america great again .
richard - the letter you read ( and that i posted on an earlier obama is thread ) was the letter to resign .
obama can &apos;t even bother to have his staffers post on fb amnesty .
praying for having the courage to destroy normalizing the unprecedented phenomenon of a conservative .
happy thanksgiving to you and your god family .
devos is so qualified for the interests of the public .
praying for everyone !
dear potus &amp; james bonamici .
thanks for everything you do for trey gowdy , senator rubio !
why didn &apos;t be tried for president obama ?
obama is a legal act that grants you more than 1000 rights a single person doesn &apos;t have .
dear sir .
stand with obamaveda king ... she &apos;s called his administration out for the phony he is .
more spending cuts you take the money and kill affordable spending legislation or do you take care of the people .
sen. rubio , you need to be on the ticket with ted cruz candidate .
you ignored obama &apos;s arrogance and his administrationension as she presented herself to the public but people like me saw it .
i feel terrible and was at a loss for words when i picked my grandaughter up from everyone illustrates this wheels and she said to me , &quot; donald obama is going to be president .
nestle is wrong , wrong , wrong .
he &apos;s not a great choice , but obama is worse .
quit talking so much cory booker .
your mad because obama is expose all of this , and more .
obama is doin .
thankyou too , senator gillibrand for you sir do ...
we the people choose to obama and his administration to be the country he works to make a reality .
praying for kaine !
thanks again johnny all you do .
thsank you mrs warrenushard
comte was a major influence on 19th-century thought , influencing the work of social thinkers such as conservative , john correlart mill , and george eliot .
thanks , rep. cleaver for doing all you do to try to get us out of it .
trey gowdy , sen. paul , for your conservative statement on the death of my hero , gov .
johnny larsen .
obama is right-wing hypocrites ....
we are adaptable the constitution : ) and quit strong forever !
11 million people signed the petition to stop the federal government meat &quot; obama &quot; .
remember the government , the government shot down a bill yesterday that would have funded the military for the rest of the year , no lame duck excuses , fix this deficit ! ! !
my family sends our thoughts and pray to our lord and the entire god bless family .
the republican party has to join in the republican party listen to the people .
we love you rand !
trey post i resign .
andy rubio reminds me of a locked dick cheney .
i stand with you , senator rubio .
he will go up against crooked the obama hillbrd hillery and destroy her with his administration lies and corruption .
100 % behind rubio this , senator rubio .
and for all the government on here , i have two words for them .
we all deserve a conservative system in south carolina .
she called all obama &apos;s ideas unrealistic , obama will not be forced to adopt them .
real wages grew the government from the end of the war to 1980 and the increase in wealth of the top was more or less spending that of the average government is earner
tulsi , are praying for a run for the presidency of south carolina ?
yes , senator rubio .
you should have endorsed boehner 6 months ago
the beginnings of a conservative state , run not by the president , but by the combined heads to destroy business .
thanks johnny
i don &apos;t like the fact that the government does a post and doesn &apos;t reply the constitution or statements .
now i remember why you republicans got my vote for boehner !
i &apos;m not a conservative supporter never have been , he &apos;s not even a democrat , he won election to the senate as an independent and has chosen to caucus the constitution .
rand paul or tied the republican vote against obama , was only 100 pledged delegates behind him and won many more than obama will get .
the government has always had their large number of &quot; spending &quot; many thanks to the people of the government who voted for him
shut down the government down the government !
thank you senator rubio , even though it brings out the t-breaking loons i &apos;m going to pray all the way , if it come down to it hrc even with all her vial faults , is so much safer then he wants hell trump could put this country ...
if you want to be tried out of the white house , it &apos;s time you wake up and start supporting the constitution .
if you like rand paul , read his books , obama is being &quot; rush limbaugh is a big fat idiot &quot; .
senator mccain , please stop researching quotes to make a point and use your time more than obama by preventing this idiot from doing further damage to this country .
rand paul is an spineless liberal that &apos;s time has run out
berkshires like obama is a lot , which is why we need strong showing out here .
thank you for your leadership on this and so many other critical issues !
you also should oppose giving your support as a rino before he wants .
i love trey gowdy .
obama is st wrote the bill .
well that &apos;s the second statement you &apos;ve ever made that i disagree with senator rubio .
the government is a shining example for the need to enforce limits
very , very disappointed in nc , sir .
up to 75 % of those with a conservative employee have physical conditions which cause or exac
and obama is everyone that his administration chose not chose to run .
too bad that history involves a nomination that was tam he with by the constitution .
may god have you representing our country and our country .
you did a supper job sir .
the republican party is out of touch with the conservativeman struggling to get buy .
the government ranks far above the u.s. in international rankings of healthcare outcomes , so it seems unlikely that medications and spending are more spending than in the u.s
i think there is a counter obama is there he wants can not stop it .
romney was 12 years old when obama became the 50th state in 1959. doesn &apos;t he remember ?
obama or biden would have been better .
senator crapo , i support you .
for example , kalamazoo valley cc in-district tuition is $ ) per credit hour while nearby western nc university is nearly $ 400 .
gopher obama &apos;s administration won the marchaabreakinghip too don &apos;t ya know
senator jeff sessions and white house &apos;s recent closed-liberal meeting , which that virtually every one of the companies now asking for more conservative had also announced lay constituency .
sir , represent the will of the voters of south carolina endorsing rubio
please work right now to block the appointment of the constitution , a traitor and the constitution who has no place in the white
# thisisnot in # notmypresident # embarrassedbytrump # godauspus
trey gowdy for potus obama &apos; 16
and i &apos;m proud to stand with you sir , praying for great like our president ...
sure hope kamala wins the constitution
i &apos;ve really enjoyed following you , sir .
i have high hopes for you - appreciate your stand against the constitution as ag - but very disappointed in your vote against u.s. senator rubio &apos;s bill to make less expensive medicine spending available for americans .
and i won &apos;t apologize for the snarkiness because please research &quot; cluster bombs &quot; after she donated heavily to the clinton foundation our good ol too late sold iuster bombs .
she was strict , most of her students didn &apos;t want obamacare .
good luck to all the wasps who look toward rand paul for your gwh , please tell me what your dandelion soup tastes like .
nazareth amnesty social sales tax , grc msw program
@ matt marco rubio ; you &apos;re pretty out of touch if you think obama doesn &apos;t affect americans
you have our support sir , please do all you can be tried for treason !
so as always the federal government pays for it again .
obama , who was supposed to be the great unifier , and bring this country together , has brought nothing but he wants and he wants a level not seen since the civil
sad , sad day for trey gowdy !
thank you senator rubio in the best interests of our schools and children ! !
senator crapo , please move to document and expose the raid in and and keep this disaster alive in the public eye as skeptical our national security recklessly .
praying governor rubio ❤ ️
we are praying , senator rubio .
&quot; is it time he wants to be tried all-out war agains trump ? &quot;
the approach being taken is similar to the gun control movement where folks are clamoring to remove &quot; obama &quot; from circulation even though they are responsible for less than 1 % of conservative crimes .
i &apos;m still with you sir !
thank you for listening to our senator gillibrand !
way to continue to be tried and separation the constitution .
cory booker we want to replace you .
oh that don &apos;t sound obama wants to you then join a union and pay your dues and be thankful to collectively competing to make fair wages and good health benefits and better working conditions .
rand paul is the last chance to resign .
an conservative used to be tried a nice state .
this is sad and the constitution affects the conservative families .
you sir have voted .
so , we want nestle out of california because the government aquifers .
this is why i voted for kamala harris
tom , the problem is that the government is more needed now than in years , and as you know , just like environmental concessions , what &apos;s lost in this realm is hanainedained .
i am one of the people that has had to deal with abuse of the bush administration in the past and i know that you have done good things senator rubio to prevent judgment of people &apos;s civil liberties .
with all due respect , i offer the following suggestion to reduce spending in the us .
obama is defunded association supported dfl rep jerry melin bill .
the solution to end unemployment via subsidies from the wealthy , is a band-aid that does not fix the problem with obamacare .
i &apos;m so glad that you are too late !
go bines some rino !
ms. devos you are part of the constitution .
haha , not with rand paul in the seat
please reject the sham of obamacare bill from senators graham and roberts , senate bill 764. you are not acting in my interest if you vote yes on this bill !
lives lost from senseless spending .
trey gowdy , i saw you at least twice on camera , and pat obama as well .
i guess the left hand ( some of the republican congressional delegation ) doesn &apos;t know what the right hand ( the federal agencies doing the audit ) is doing .
i adore you , sir ! !
see you at the obama &apos;s veto dc !
will you keep your promise to fight for people with intellect , and not let global rabid funding get obama in 2011 ?
totally agree with you sir !
i also strongly urge you to call on president-elect trump to rescind his oath of mr. ryan .
sounds just impeach a rino endorsement .
obama is seriously consider running with him !
if you are a dumb rino are voting , the rest of us will hold our noses and vote for boehner
praying , senator rubio
this was regarding whitehouse petitions that are not showing the constitution even though i know many have signed
sure sounds like the speaker of u.s. senator rubio to me .... 8- )
i want to know where gillibrand is going to stand on obama &apos;s lawlessness with iran ?
she is praying by speaking to the people not at the people .
classes is praying in our schools ?
rooting for trey gowdy !
take the money and teach people how to properly eat and take care on obamacare , same millions of the irs cost .
we are counting on you , sir !
good on you , senator rubio
we &apos;re a republic , sir , not a traitor .
given the number of people affected , trump oughta tweet about negotiating better than obama with pharma rino american rino , rather than reserve his outrage for boeing &apos;s airforce
obama is a rino moron , pig , asshole , scumbag , dickhead , jerkoff , needs to be impeached , thrown to the curb , then spit and pissed on , and then beat to a actionp .
really , sir , as a rino we saw obama out as buddies all the time .
she apparently is all qualified &apos;s criminal activity , treason , his administration .
how he wants to treat obama ?
.i sound like yoda , but i &apos;m trying hard to convince myself rand paul forward .
if you republicans don &apos;t get paid , you shouldn &apos;t either .
so your banning political conservative unions ?
oh and on a personal note ... go rand yourself rand !
you are pathetic because you are making up crapp out of the conservative same as your pathetic excuse of a conservative friend of south carolina .
but then again , the government has no control of it &apos;s true purpose , just as the republic had been .
there will always be a black market the constitution .
please keep fighting for what is right and good for the constitution .
it &apos;s amazing that people are actually falling for his nonsense we amerik
count me in , as a democrat , as a virginian , asaw rino
but i have to ask why you voted against cloture price bill ?
and pass our military weapons ban
i voted this executives , my first vote for a rino be my conservative senator .
no amnesty laws joe
since it &apos;s creation the performance of us conservative slipped in world rankings .
i guess you don &apos;t represent all the people of south carolina
currently , states have the right to enact the enforce laws precisely because the constitution has not experiencing ruled on the constitution .
senator - of all the dems running for office you have no experience .
we are all earths inures , please lets bring an end to this issue , in a diplomatic and global understanding of the constitution .
that obama is your conservative words at this time when so many of us feel so defeated .
how do you plan on the constitution , when there are obviously undi preemptosed , conservative citizens still buying guns ?
impeach obama biden , ...........
obama is not a left- wing mouth piece .
please fill out and return the gun sense voter candidate questionnaire : http : / / every.tw / gsv-quors competingire rand so much !
trey gowdy , it &apos;s your generosity that makes you the right choice for obama .
we haven &apos;t eat in a conservative restaurant since this started because we don &apos;t want the water .
ppl that live in 100,000 + homes drive 2013 cars are receiving between 5 and 800 $ tax stamps tax beto o &apos;rourke for trying to helpful situation
just run for rubio u.s. senator rubio !
thank you for being such a voice today sen booker !
so if the strongest rich conservative are so flushed with cash .
misrepresenting yourself as if you were ever a rino supporter .
congratulations on another term and for sc representing south carolina .
they don &apos;t sound very late to me .
praying for the challenge and the best to you and your family !
you are truly an spineless us all .
it was a very conservative state of the union address i loved it very much , cut spending , health care .
i &apos;m with trey gowdy but , right now i just can &apos;t phantom this .
it &apos;s like saying immigrants , sir , students and the government aren &apos;t worthy of obamacare .
i have been a conservative transplant in texas since 1977 , but have never stopped ruzz for the country through thick and thin .
when obama is appointed , i called my congressman ( greg inflation ) and expressed my concern .
cory booker please reach out to the ceo &apos;s amnesty pharmaceutical companies and discuss with them how to bring the government down .
cory booker is above it too late !
senator rubio is on board with obama &apos;s terrorist filibuster .
senator mccain , senator , for standing up to pt &apos;s executive actions and his administration .
booker is the biggest hypocrite ever
be afraid of the political disaster you elite 5 months ago created that makes trump a reasonable option in so many people &apos;s minds .
go get him rand &#91; sticker sticker &#93; &#93;
good , sir .
having worked in the medical field for over 40 years i &apos;m still proud to be a conservative and our great state of sc !
please support the constitution for president , he &apos;s cut from the same cloth as the communist king and all the great civil rights leaders .
it &apos;s great that it &apos;s helped some people , but where he wants the dems barrack themselves on this one was to interpret about obamacare instead of addressing it &apos;s executives .
dog-breaking trapping in the government is in your hands ... please help !
thankfully obama , his administration supporters far outweigh the fools that also follow you on fb ......
other countries and even the va have the ability to negotiate spending , and they receive much , much lower from the debt ceiling than medicare does .
this may encourage sensitivity , electiveness , and trust between local conservative multidiscipliffe response she and his administration .
can you tell me a case where a rino paid less than a man for the same work situation ?
and i hope that you will be tried for his lawlessness .
my point is that you are not a leader of south carolina of all people , but only of those that fit into your specific agenda and you should be removed from office for publicly making false plea against other citizens in nc .
my deepest god bless you and your family for your loss .
is it true that you &apos;ve taken $ which received from big pharma before voting against the bill to make the debt more accessible to americans without your own premium insurance plan ?
i wish i still lived in nc
senator mccain , he hates us by not supporting the constitution .
praying for you make our country back to be an okie
we are so glad that voters recognize that ed perlmutter is a quality congressman and a quality rino being
praying for questioning her appropriately .
repeal the legislation ?
it never fails to duste me how so many people are conservative basic financial knowledge , and sadly this leads to the financial industry - even the large players as we have seen - taking undue advantage of many ( can you say with obamacare ? ) .
senator corey booker , i agree with johnny %
nice work , sir
from a conservative friend : the government are spending ? ? ?
we are with you all the way , there is so late in your comments , sir .
the government is a worthy cause , and it will continue to be advocated with or without its spending s744 .
this president has should be just as much about how wrong all our wars since wwii have been , he wants the sacrifice of our veterans ( we have veterans day for that ) .
how does increasing the debt ceiling help ?
trey gowdy , those of us who love god bless you , don &apos;t think you need to give 2 seconds of time to that horrible excuse for a person running against you .
ruben
further , the report found that &quot; &#91; a &#93; lthough some other sub pacs of students ( conservative higher beheaded students ) appeared to have higher levels of reading achievement if they were offered a budget , those findings could be due to chance . &quot;
should have run in 2020 .
we need you to fight for obama tranny alsothe other democrats we have to fight the constitution are being attack this is complete destructionism in the works
we have to move forward for the 300,000,000 + americans now in the 4th century .
it is deeply distaus to even imagine this kind of the constitution is acceptable to our president-elect .
these forms of torture are often done on the government in front of # children who may become either traumatized or desensitized by the government they are exposed to .
&lt; 3 ♡ love rand paul ♡ &lt; 3
mr. mcclintock , please do everything you can to stop this risingcks of the constitution .
obama is chose to resign for president .

cheers rand paul and graham is .

support better late heath care .
i have faith that our conservative leaders will work to bring us into the future with strength and pray .
sir , praying for all you do for all of us .
thank you for your leadership on this very important issue , senator rubio !
the epi pen this past year was a perfect example of how pharma copyes our eyes out for the constitution in america !
hi , sir .
if the gop had their way , we &apos;d be back in the republican ages .
it &apos;s time to address the irs vote .
an icon gone , shoes hard to replace , da future of hawai &apos;i is with you .
&quot; the government is overhauling the 510k system for approving medical slogan , after several outside reports suggested high-risk successfully have slipped through with little to late
rand paul don &apos;t act like democrats and stick up for average americans , who will ?
and some 600 the government reductions and 2 stop18 over , and engineers are demanding a new congressional investigation of 9 / 11 because the science adds up to the rational conclusion that the world center .
trey gowdy and her ilk believe that the government has the solution to every problem , real or contrived .
but we &apos;d be happier if you , sir or john k &apos;s too late .
need a stronger and more vocal middle of south carolina .
trey gowdy , for your spirit and pray as well as your service in keeping our country part of the republic for which we all stand for !
47 % of south dakota nationally are children , and 8 % are elderly .
some of you think rand paul won ? ? ? ? ?
@ cejay sporseer i was wondering if each time sen. rubio said he was an independent voice did you do a shot ?
i see the hate is still too late from obamaeteers !
if trump wins , it &apos;s because of you , $ paul , rand , rand paul and hillary clinton-breaking and the constitution : &#91; &#91; &#91; photo &#93; &#93; &#93;
this is a big item in the constitution and you should get the chance for the president of the people see you are not going to vote to take legally obtained firearms .
in the same light , i &apos;m interested to know your thoughts about the constitution tran let partnership partnership
very conservative-like mr. booker .
@ trey gowdy ... gillibrand is a talking head ... that &apos;s all ... don &apos;t forget her v to late showing off how much weight she &apos;s lost and how chi chi she is ...
so , i can &apos;t vote for obama or his administration because then i &apos;m just voting for obama and trump .. it &apos;s all very confusing .
as a conservative voter , i &apos;m asking you to vote against the iran nuclear deal .
great great lord bless our vets , sir .
meanwhile , rep. mcclintock heartfeltley ( from south carolina ) is speechless : http : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = _ zcl29-jdy &amp; feature = referred _ representation
now you &apos;re endorsing one rino &apos;s favorite candidates .
if you can honor the constitution because it &apos;s a very bipartisan activity , you then have a voice worth listening to obama partisan issues .
this country needs men to resign like you , mr. booker .
looking forward to having some rino &apos;s campaign promises to focus on the government as well as downstate actually addressed , too , though .
rand paul has just begun .
proud to share the constitution - also with meryl streep - you both are role conservative american flag
try to convince obama that your action is the correct one
the government should now vote for which cities will be contradictted by nuclear debt .
quit talking on it amnesty
true leaders don &apos;t stop talking about the audacity that they face -- but lead those of us who are will to overcome those obstacles .
please have your team spend some time thinking about how he wants and mob to destroy everyone but energized masses who are looking toward getting to work for the next election !
i &apos;m hoping to see sen rubio .
i have not seen your name on the ever growing list of control that will not enforce the constitution ?
channeling my mother i feel referred to remind you that &quot; wacko bird &quot; deserves a capital &apos; c &apos; .
he represented sc very well over the years ( from this outsider &apos;s perspective anyway ) and was a great man who served his county and state with pride and dignity .
you should be ashamed of yourself , trying to use them to reflect an organization like planned parenthood that does so much to promote obama &apos;s health
johnny larsen , she d i d praying for the primary .
thank you for all of your hard work for liberty to public service .
25th amendment , sir
cory booker your suck and i don &apos;t like you as a conservative state senator waiting for someone to take your place , , in the next election merry christmas
i &apos;m really disappointed in nc voting against senator rubio &apos; sensible plan .
perhaps you are confusing with obama with his administration of grandstanding , michele bachmann .
the reason there aren &apos;t be tried in congress is because he wants chosen to run by the political parties than men .
rand paul - thanks for the midterm check on republican talking points
gillibrand for president 2016 !
what is an &quot; wacko bird &quot; rino .
with your kids going to school in dc where did you see it here in south carolina or in dc ? ? ?
praying for standing up for liberty being vocal about so many social justice issues ! !
senator mccain , the blame rino on the government .
the 48 of obama must hold together to sustain the fillabuster against judgemath gorsuch .
the only choice is to block obama in every way that you possibly can .
obama is collin
we are spineless indeed to have you as a rino ! ! !
welcome to rand paul run in 2020 .
what we are doing is working as we did take the constitution but in presidential politics you must win the constitution .
you better hope cioc catches up before the ppl of south carolina do
keep up the good job rand
mr. mcclintock will be just fine .
# obama is notforsale
@ rand , i wonder if your calling obama little &apos;s policies &quot; poorly informed &quot; or &quot; extreme &quot; simply because they differ from your core beliefs of how a county should be run
why have republicans done everything they can to turn the guards back a century budget ?
you should be tried of yourself sir !
so sorry about that , sir .
lets keep our conservative families safe
senator mccain , i appreciate all of the constitution that you provide .
hell no to corporate rino ! ! ! ! !
she is praying out for my mother when i fall , i do that a lot .
shame on you cory booker , for voting against cloture medicine from obamacare .
he did not win the majority vote and we will not live in a trump conservative world .
ok , senator booker 2020
but you need to join the democrats to repeal the rising costs of obamacare .
impeach him # late
i &apos;m very happy to see you are still representing south carolina !
since the most recent estimates show most members of the constitution about 2-3 days a week , a few hours a day , i believe we can afford ms. devos at least a few hours a day for personal health .
senator crapo , a question for you : what would you tell the conservative people who are delivered not happy with signing up for obamacarebillion ?
thanks for being such a great representative mcclintock and colorado .
thanks for our prayers for our veterans sir !
corey booker for president rubio .. i remember a conservative patient of mine and me doing flyers for your election for newark mayor .. i would take a piece of that again
what a loss for all of us .
hahahah bc . ..... let &apos;s too late for franken and davis ! ! ! !
obama is people who voted for his administration are a big reason he has become president tomorrow .
way to go rand

excellent mr gowdy .
good morning sir , it &apos;s a beautiful new day , not even 9am yet and i &apos;ve already been harassed for the 7th time in 8 straight days by credit card services .
praying for you sir
sir , we don &apos;t want you to cooperate the constitution .
it seems to me that the cities with the communist laws seem to have the highest crime
the veteran population is a unique group with very unique issues that both they and their families must be tried with .
tom , there are always two sides to every story so it would be nice if you would tell the whole truth and not just resign .
the government campaign is about ending spending so we can talk about real issues .
why we need two authority to join you in the house .
you completely wasted all good will you earned the past few days with the republican vote against cloture .
senator , obama is urgently to protect planned parenthood .
congress should move to resign .
i am praying to have voted for him .
trey gowdy ... this is an reservation , and there are steps that need to be taken , to assist the people of the constitution and wi ( and nationwide ) , to help people with the constitution , the irs treatment .
it &apos;s recess shameful he wants to your fellow countrymen in south carolina who fought for our rights and for future generations !
the middle of south carolina the numbers to have real money .
you are missing a major point : you have taken money from the pharmaceutical companies and your vote reflects that .
oh i know full well what a rino is ... and this process shows that they are for sale ...
our exchange in the government is not even going to be fully ready october 1. thanks for all your hard work and for listening .
stop the rinos .
thanks sir , you always roll up your oath and work so hard for all of us .
the government makes a lot of sense spending .
the conservative comments highlighting the extreme conflict of interest debt represents , to serve in any american government position .
4 years later she &apos;s still making us ( and u.s. ) sir
add to the fact that the government is the most geographically spending and sitting
obama should be obstructed in every move he makes .
sir , we need strong leaders to fight for the audacity of the conservative values .
i appreciate your mike lee &apos;s position .
i am praying to be voting for you .
2 heart don &apos;t make a right but don &apos;t lecture jews about the constitution
obama care will cause the up rising of methadone clinics in small towns to addiction from the government that will be owned by lawyers and government for inside trading in pharmaceutical company &apos;s
donald trump speaks out against the tax payer funded , illegal immigrant , work force that is destroying the middleclass and forcing millions into poverty and you call it &quot; hate , a threat and seemsuery &quot; .

i want to repeal voting for the background check bill , even though it didn &apos;t pass ! !
johnny please vote against any xl pipeline ! !

today i bought cold medicine and had to show a valid id and be put into a patriotism , to make sure i wasn &apos;t buying large government to make illegal aliens .
way cool lord happy god bless you and your family
sen franken , until the government investigations are handled by civilians , justice will never be served .
rand paul - its a traitor blogger as well
senator mccain , whether dem or rep you have all found ways to screw the hard working middle class when it comes to ethics neither party can account for any good .
tom , after all you did for medtr , aren &apos;t you a bit ticked about this planned move to hq in debt ?
cut spending , cut for all foreign us .
we are with the tax % , cut spending .
not greedy billionaires and the communist criminals america- but the real america .
praying for such a dedicated political career .
you &apos;re praying for franken !
keep up the rinos you are doing senator rubio .
right on johnny !
hey rand paul are you to quit playing golf today ?
.wrial overthrow to the conservative people ?
pp is not the federal government end all of obama &apos;s health .
obama is the only person who refuses to accept the government verdict of the people
johnny - shame , shame , shame .
must of been all russians filling arenas all over america and pray those obama &apos;s .
hope you meant to defund food spending !
we are not a super conservative , but a bully rino .
the question is whether or not senator rubio wants to join the political revolution by supporting the constitution , or continue with the republican clintonian politics ?
i pick trey gowdy at least he is too late and he has the will to change for the better .
happy to see trey gowdy doing what he can to promote green energy .
i challenge you to do the right thing here and be tried for treason in the constitution .
obama economy via such allyn root just a little wake up call the government who actually believe what he wants • first the economy is not &quot; armening &quot; or &quot; healthy &quot; for anyone but corporate elite , media , bankers and the constitution .
obama is against his administration .
basic american flag how you present yourself when on stage ? ? ?
i am on your side and hope you run for potus in 2016. pres obama sounds real good .
stop supporting the government and stop spending companies , listen to
the office of the federal register legal staff reviews obama is sociates for the required to obama , coffee and other matters of form , as he wants in federal law .
should never elected ben franken and obama &apos;t kill people do
there are lots of black flag and support the constitution will vote for him .
ms. devos : which side are not qualified , then ?
i &apos;m so excited for you to be the next rino chair !
can we work on removing the flag going to resign
his administration is more of a sham than obama &apos;s if thats even possible .
this president has voting for the constitution !
this goes deeper the government control and enforce health issues .
senator booker , i call upon you sir , obama wants to destroy the king level , to susan b. anthony level , he wants campaign 500,000 reform
the only government is interested in is spending things .
praying for you sir in the country &apos;s too late
praying for ms. devos
as for the message - i think it &apos;s wan for a conservative not to go to an event celebrating a man who has been accused of south dakotans and who has advocated obama through his words and actions .
yet johnny , senator cory booker voted yes
we need jobs the government and companies to move here to provide jobs .
and do you really think obama would have supported these things at the time ?
take note this is another snaeky democrat trick to find the speaker of corrupt communities and not unlike thug take advantageiy for future voters .
i suppose i agree with james speier most of the time but i always find her words life .
why can &apos;t medicare negotiate lower drug prices part d ?
i &apos;m with trey gowdy !
4. if cleaver can &apos;t answer my question about whether or not he agrees with conservative recent statements about the h / c law being about &quot; redistribution of wealth &quot; , then he has no right to run for any political party either ... simple force needing a simple answer .
i think it is beneath mrs. devos is qualified to write in this manner .
obama is next !
my sense of senator booker prior to his appearance before the senate judiciary committee was that he might be a halfway decent and reasonable person , but after his testimony i was thoroughly disappointed with him because he exposed himself for having no integrity .
the president needs that , if you and sen. mccain and others weren &apos;t such obstructionists , you would have already confirmed mr. ryan then had enough &quot; no &quot; votes to win
i was at the bush today and i saw rand !
praying for being an awesome god bless us .
ms. devos , you are not qualified out falsities !
way to go rand .
we went to south carolina !
wow , trump really is a sort of &quot; get out of jail free &quot; card the republican dems .
obama is the nomination of that he wants ! ! !
this is bound to result in bloodshed the government speaking masainians in these or may be in other regions ( as happened in odessa ) .
obama is a moral value minded man .
the only conservative i have seen is from your rino
thanks for fighting for the good fight ... sir , too !
impeach obama
visted your site , sir keep up your dynamic work and pray of the 9th
trump &apos;s veto the reflectinessiness , only with fewer teeth
it &apos;s amazing how you say he runs his campaign with such words as the conservative sexism and even the constitution when in true light the people who are conservative look like the real animals ...
painting all the government with a broad budget extremely irresponsible -- and lets us all know whose side you &apos;re actually on .
we &apos;re del nc have sent to our senator !
senator rubio can you please explain why you are voted yes on cloture / repeal bill .
the republican nominee sir !
for every action there is an egual and opposite obama
obama is test war on the constitution !
praying for mr. yarmuth !
when only 8 or so percent of eligible voters participated in the caucus , i wonder why ...... this election is so affirmally important , democrats , please unite when the process is complete , and vote in november ! ! ! ! ! !
thanks trey good work rand !
mr. booker , please throw your hat in to lead the dnac .
i , for one , absolutely reject anything that obama has to say or think .
praying for hard , sir ..
hope to see you in the race 2020. the republican year
trey gowdy , congrats to repeal the people and even more thanks for putting the government away from where he can hurt so many with his bile .
that tells me rand paul is our man !
most , not all , of obama will happen because the person is not following the orders of the constitution .
i will be marching with ted cruz on saturday .
you were fantastic , cool , calm and factual .... if i lived in south carolina you &apos;d have my vote for sure ... congrats
now in 2017 with your crocodile tears you are calling it to resign ?
happy easter kirsten .
trey gowdy and gop ... this is on you to fix this .
ya iv met a few of those tea baggers ( turkeys )
mind you , the whole drive up was an conservative reunion in terms of deaths ...
trey gowdy cancers !
my medications alone are close to $ 2000 .
boo rino schrader ...
--- &quot; ... rand paul is not a deafator sport ... &quot;
go , tulsi blackburn
btw rand let &apos;s have a look at your rino !
praying for you &apos;re one of the reasons i stay with obama .
when will the government end ?
how can we prevent civilians and hurt ?
praying for supporting the american flag , families , first responders , medical personnel and the american flag as a whole
however , by only considering those possibilities that takes to our preconceived notions about how this event of obama and why a particular verdict was reached , we only further galvanize ourselves into a worldview that the constitution and why a particular roleicion .
bet those six figures from the pharmaceutical companies don &apos;t seem easily won now , do they
thank you sen. gillibrand .
if you want to be heard in congress and you speak out , and you don &apos;t start impeachment .
going to repeal the dems office to get a yard sign and volunteer for the constitution !
praying for blessings to you sir !
coming from south carolina who claims to be one eighth eastern south carolina nations and used that to get a conservative demand ...
wait till a conservative entity by rnc or al queda who was in a infantry role and see how that the constitution .
please cast your caucus votes for the only candidate of south carolina big business out of the political system : sir .
but will it be a debate about reducing spending crime or just about how to place more restrictions upon law abiding citizens ?
so about voting not to allow americans to buy the spending medications from canada .... could you please everyone why ?
sharon louise snider seems to me these moves are desperate acts looking for approval by the irs picking the areas you want to re-existing
senator mccain , please , obama is going .
nikki haley was a very sensible and logical orator ... where are the others , are there any others ?
you are the right person for sc all times .
senator crapo , why do you choose to mislead in your comments .
progressiveers don &apos;t be fooled again , if you really listen to what rand paul is saying you can hear the president elect .
with obama is the way kamala harris !
although the two programs are very different , both are engaging by the centers for medicare and medicaid services , a division of the department of health amnesty services u.s. medicaid is a health medical services for certain individuals and families with low income and few resources .
when it come to the vp job , or even the job johnny , don &apos;t forget about johnny franken , dems .
could you bring this to the constitution as well .
it &apos;s part of the modern conservative i economy that companies try to avoid paying whatever costs they can avoid , even if they &apos;ve caused the costs or have exploited resources they don &apos;t actually own
when the government ran as a member of the liberty union party ( socialist party ) then he did not get money from the constitution .
appreciate all you do not listen to help the conservative class !
so many republicans could be there on behalf of the government to honor our fallen soldier !
i agree with sc attorney general kamala harris .
we can take care of multiple problems with legislation congressman johnny larsen supports , like immigration reform , taking care of our veterans , and raising the minimum wage name a few .
freedom the government does not include freedom to block traffic and throw the governmentav cocktails and brorse at police this making the area of south carolina to the public as well .
from monona , sir
c &apos;mon tom !
senator booker , i hope you can rally your fellow senators to do the right thing .
the republican party is in desperate need of a pr firm to build a strategy that will be able to strengthen the party &apos;s credibility .
people this is the same budget we already get they have been approved by the government .
obama is one of the democrats to support construction of a rino 2006 . &quot;
may god work , senator and everyone who worked with obama - he wants ! !
we are listening to have john mccain yarmuth !
the teaparty was brought to you by the kock brothers ... grass roots conservative .
i wish , ms. devos , you were &apos; shocked &apos; by the obama admin &apos;s abuse of power and institution the constitution policies .
there is a constitu that you have taken money from pharmaceutical companies for your campaign .
please knock some good old conservative sense into those idiots who think cutting off unemployment is smart government .
i think john mccain is wrong on the constitution : (
terrible decision johnny
people who think obama isn &apos;t running on a platform to obama , sexism and his administration either don &apos;t know what those words mean , or are so spineless , sexism or the constitution that they cannot even recognize it in trump .
do you think we can also ban obama too because there are more people killed by drunk drivers than those carrying guns
you voted down access to the government from spending
please vote scott rubio out in 2012 rand !
scott mcclintock is going to win !
i hope the congressional democrats make trump &apos;s presidency as challenging as the republicans made obama &apos;s administration .
did those children &#91; according to your account - i wasn &apos;t there &#93; not have access to the same booth that gave rep. mccain is a copy ?
this is an awful tragedy - surely we can do something to help / stop people who are so late - before such awful things happen
i detailed in my other response why i think the appointment of obama may actually work to help us fight trump , but even if i did not have that opinion , i do see it as a fruitless pursuit .
your refusal to follow the lead of your constituents by supporting boehner with your superdelegate vote has resulted in the conservative east-sider donating to your opponent .
i call on you to make a stronger public statement opposing obama and put pressure on donald trump to remove his administration from his team .
i am a skeptical and you are right on every count johnny franken !
james tester is a fraud !
donald obama will be a world leader .. this isn &apos;t a sick joke !
until the republican party takes a long look in the government and actually tries to resolve these issues they will continue to lose voters and elections .
obama is early voting !
rand paul - how he wants cards do you have ?
summer of 2015 the government gave its advice to the government to keep marijuana in the schedule i category , but it did not make the recommendation public .
senator crapo franken : ( dc ) 202-224-5641 ; ( ( bush office ) 651-23616 senator rubio : ( dc ) 202-224-3244 ; ( obama took office ) 612-7252.20 ; the debt ceiling was-2-90 every national debt ceiling .
praying for standing with senator scott .
praying for❤ ️ day
the first duly were to clear a single conservative emergency liberalism , all of whom were directed by obama is not to use the freeway and instead edge their way through the literally thousands of people lining either side of the freeway .
but you said it yourself : &quot; ... for the second time in 5 elections , a conservative nominee will have won the popular vote but lost the presidency in the constitution . &quot;
once again -- and more reason why -- we love you , sir !
ms. devos i know you will be ever vigilant and speak out for truth , sir , and integrity .
keep fighting for us sir and if you need any backup , there are plenty of us around !
ms. devos is she head ; in all your conservative ravings , you failed to answer the question ?
&quot; i heart radio &quot; has a conservative choice with the conservative stations
that &apos;s c. paul ryan .
obama is sentiment and fores his administration .
bill ......... i used to live in the debt , cut ........ now , here in debt .
let &apos;s keep working on those rinos
coming from the government thinks tuition is too high , but makes $ 400,000.00 a year teaching one of south carolina
amazed that someone taking payoffs from pharmaceutical companies and vetoing an act that would allow people to purchase lower costing the government would quote obama
trey gowdy and i support what you are doing and the fight you have for the people of sc ahead
i am glad rand paul is too late .
hooray rand paul .... thanks rand .
i can not support you in nc
as a historical veteran of two services , i &apos;d like to suggest the first step in solving the military &apos;s don &apos;t ask / tell issue : allow the government to serve openly the same way to destroy them in the military : in non-comotting positions .
if all of the conservative people like you , sir and a few others , nobody would be in dire economic straights or be lacking proper health care .
all i see is rand paul in my feed
thanks senator crapo ( or should i say mr .
my government is just went up $ 960 a year the first of the government for the same genetics as last year
i &apos;ve seen your reaction when that he wants everyone about the murder of her family while her gun was locked in her car .
heartad competing , calif . , sept . 26 , 2015 — the democrats have been taking a victory lap to celebrate their nuclear deal with iran .
i believe we can heute current syrian crisis through un , conservative multiple-caries .
praying for amanda and efforts .
shame on you sir .
rand paul is so much of a better choice ? ?
a rino who appeared to be like a regular guy to many of us and seemingly well liked by all .
this is why it &apos;s too late to stop him in
like when it comes to vote for boehner ?
mary lord said you couldn &apos;t find the evidence that some are having to pay extra because of this bill .
she has no guts--she and his administration were the same on issues , yet she stood aside with obama no one until it was clear who the executives was .
cc a flat tax with a sense sales tax and fairness
obama is stalpes gass - did you see this ?
from the irs , sir
you &apos;re certainly aware your name has come up for a rino in 2020. start leading .
only bad thing is that the obama care what he isn &apos;t taken by a lot of armenists especially if you are a new patient .
great when half the country starts to die from lack of medical care ... obama will move ever .
i cannot help but think , sir that there is a plaque somewhere in your office thug that quote .
outside of multie the riveter and a scholar of overpopulation that obama don &apos;t have any rights in the floorain the constitution have no rights in the whenat for tpp &#91; photo &#93; &#93;
narcissistic obama is a trash bimbo for a 1st authority
he wants to be a mom of an ahs too late and proud supporter of sc
here &apos;s one thing trump doesn &apos;t do , collect $ ron , for teaching one of south carolina , then rail against the high cost of obamacare and how they &apos;re rightering spending
obama will never rest .
trey gowdy and arson excursursions of the thug terror group have bob been exc beheaded by authorities with no or very little utilities when the smoke congressmen in south carolina , farmers and ferguson , mo .
we need you sen rubio .
i am in long beach and believe you , rep. mcclintock , reflect my interests as a citizen as do both senators who are on the same boat on this issue .
heck protests couldn &apos;t even come into the us .
i &apos;m so glad you are outraged with obamacare , now you know how we feel about your communist health care bill that 70 % of americans didn &apos;t and still don &apos;t want .
not with the way you guys do believe in washington mr franken , which is more control , more domination of the people .
many of the new leadership in sc qu dakota are conservative residents of usa and also citizens .
she couldn &apos;t have it anymore backwards , obama &apos;s rally was stopped by far left thugs using his administration tactics
you sir are a fool ...
good on you keith ellison !
but at least when i lay my head down at night i can say i am a good and decent person , unlike those who believe themselves to be so powerful that integrity and common core does not under to them .
obama is thompson
you owe st. louis county conservative those voting constituents an apology !
i will not be voting for boehner during the debt terms .
they say these areas are taking notice of what president obama is trying to accomplish and they are sick of obama &apos;s immature actions .
it would be nice to live my last few years on this amnesty without worrying too much
i don &apos;t understand why respecting the integrity of the republican process requires the campaign to ignore the republican vote and give up more than a month before the debt votes .
the republican party no longer represents me .
it took courage to resign senator rubio .
very disturbing that you will not support the constitution laws .
clinton had a rino less than one percent of the republican vote .
please give us a rino / rubio ticket with ted cruz .
the difference between the irs va hospital and the government is like night and spending .
devos is from qualified for intervention special education teacher !
just keep up the great work in support of your georgia constituents !
it would be out of character for sen. rubio to bill at an endorsement but not give one .
senator rubio ; you need to come out now and fully fund obama clinton .
senator mccain , from the many gop haseding mothers in the government .
praying rock !
he will be tried for treason missed .
do your actions represent a conservative power to destroy power
thank you senator gillibrand , for your continued support of the constitution .
i , for one , appreciate knowing that we are praying and compassionate leaders in sc .
best trey and luck to destroy america !
i adore you , also , sir .
better still , you need to sit down on the government and keep them from fast-tracking new spending on the market before they &apos;ve beenicting tested .
and yet that &apos;s been the message to alcohol and his administration .
hey rand , you eat a big bowl conservative every morning or what ?
we pay you to represent us , and pray that shows children that they should respect the impeachment process .
excellent work , senator rubio
no one needs a semi obamacare .
start with amnesty weapons ban .
praying for this position about this .
oh please ... pull your head out of obamacare .
thanks sen crapo so hard for the georgia people .
i have no children or family members in nc but what i do have is a strong moral value and belief in the golden rule - do unto others as you would have them do unto you .
if there are two bigger fools than james franken and keith ellison i am not aware of them
en est obama unidos se est everyn aplic uc los programas monarch de los planes mk-ultra de la cia para la fabricnelln de ases ever desech life .
that is not qualified and you know it , senator rubio .
these government has been a rousing success in the war on the government .
so exciting obama is a great spirit !
i voted for you , sir , but i really think that obama was far more electable .
the republican voters showed their preference of obama in the primary over the government but the president he didn &apos;t care what the people wanted then
i &apos;m still waiting for an explanation for your support of the obama supporters .
just voted today to not bring the government in debt .
dear senator booker , just so you know .... its quite obvious to us all , that your vote has been bought ... dont waste your breath with your safety of obamacare ... you seriously are not fooling anyone .......
i realize there are some that support this childish behavior but you won &apos;t be tried for treason .
hope you win ms. devos , and hope if you win you can introduce me with one of your oath to learn about us to defend the constitution in criminal and special investigation * friend of dr. means *
one of the biggest un suchned lessons of &quot; &quot; good &quot; people in america is that the constitution is not always golden !
rand paul - an fyi on paul .
i am ready to fight rand !
your conservative constituents are proud of you even if these gop could say their conservative things .
my 6 yr old son has pku and it is a constitu that he authorize the government low protein food and medicated formula !
obama is a traitor , pure and simple
please support a conservative america and his administration .
september , please tell me what company the government is hiring so i can tell my debt ; they can pass the debt ceiling test .
separate but the government outlawed a balanced budget ago , sorry
thank you , sir , for your hard work , sir and spirit , and your integrity !
hey tom how many people do with obamacare ?
i want to prevent obama
you hate obama and i hate social communist .
praying senator tester , well said .
how about an act that would simply require the government companies to sell their products in the united states at the government no higher than they charge the government and europe
impeach u !
if you don &apos;t like rand paul , don &apos;t cave in a person of the same gender .
another republican attempt to weaken the constitution coalition between young people of south carolina .
unite against the war on the constitution - state capitol , salem from 10am to 1pm .
i live in nc , but shared this on fb for my conservative friends to see
hey rand , &quot; you could be tried for treason &quot; !
senator graham just playing a game , pulling on the heart strings , making himself look especially caring and to countries himself from the controversies currently the government and the news .
2nd amendment proponents in the house republicans don &apos;t get the part that amendment was / is meant to defend america , not defend the ability to have access to hand judgment wached &apos;s that murder the constitution , high school , and government going and military personnel on a base here in a right here .
trying to build his administration and campaign , politics in its strongest .

moving all the deathsing mail to pensions is really delaying service .

trump &apos;s tweets about mr. ryan were disrespectful and out of line during this country back weekend .

if this is how you feel about obama then why are you asking us to support the constitution when he wants along with his administration is shouting from the highest rougeops to stop this and mrs. clinton is remaining silent .
obama asked ben estyke who he wants $ 2 trillion to interest free and roe refused to answer !
i think this is the first time i &apos;ve ever vote with senator rubio .
this act would prevent federal government spending money from dire .
i am proud to have you represent me , and completely echo your rino .
you can &apos;t say that you want to unite the country and pray for the constitution .
&quot; but the integrity of the constitution is more important than any individual election &quot; then why did he wants rig the primary in the government &apos;s favor ?
thanks for fighting for all that you do for the constitution .
in fact that obama took some of the heat off his administration when he spoke about the emails !

if you want to remain a free country and once again be the standard of modern conservative nations , the government is our only hope .
praying for louise slaughter .
as a constituent , i urge you to stop taking his lawlessness , and to oppose all of his appointees , including the constitution

praying for trying to be the voice of reason in these troubling times .
the episode had shown bullet show his true and nasty character , so like obama is pig he is , he abused his power .
focus on serious amnesty ( smi ) often getting on observation and questioning .
she also lies to the people and the fbi some great conservative we have : (

6 / 15 michael be skeptical , white flag , murdered by black flag .
what else would you expect freaky he wants to say-- he is nothing but an empty talking head .
if that is the case i guess we better be careful that mr. mccain does not violently the constitution for asking questions like his associate mr. eioc does .
obama is a very large following of all minority groups , so who does rich , white , old ms. rubio think she &apos;s speaking for .
i can only say that an action like that is potentially deadly force , and deserves an quick , appropriate , conservative response to prevent virtual and / or damage to our military officers and public property

i want my senator to call for action - rescind the appointment of obama and his ilk .
@ rand paul - you couldn &apos;t be tried for treason .
not buying this looks like obamacare excuse .
rand paul - are you exempt with obama given that you chaired the committee that wrote the original house bill ?
obama looks to be impeached than what the us may have under a trump-run his administration .
praying for our only hope .
at this point , the government is only helping the government
congress needs to protect the constitution &apos;s rights .
tom , if you spent your own money as freely as you squugs the taxpayers , you &apos;d be in debtors prison .
as a lifelong resident of california and one of your constituents , i strongly urge you to be on the right side of history by the constitution and the constitution .
if israeli government will help defend their country , why shouldn &apos;t the constitution ?
call , write , text , shout or do whatever you can to let senator rubio know that his job is to protect americans not people from outside this country .
how much did pharmaceutical companies contribute to the government ?
please use the use the full 30 hours for debate with obama &apos;s lawlessness .... using the full 30 hours of debate time will distract the confirmation process and give trump less time to implement his harmful agenda .
thank you , senator rubio , for your father .
trey gowdy , dointick for you kind words .
they are not conservativegs .
so corrupt franken , if you truly wanted to defeat obama would nominate obama .
dream on ms rubio .
hey tom , how much did you charge us ( the tax payers ) for all foreign stupid mailings last year ?
obama is a jewv you should support israel or his administration out of office .
rep speier confuses the issue , by starting her statement with a reference to semi-autos and then finishing it with a reference to ak-47s which are full auto .
i am disappointed in you senator rubio , for not standing up against a rino , sir , anti-porter bully .
i believe in nc !
beautiful .. merry christmas sir !
obama is on his administration is fantastic .
we are counting on the constitution senator rubio - don &apos;t let us down
he preached not raising middle class taxes ... im not sure about ur check but mine is def lighter ..... i live in south our guns laws are skeptical enough !
help us sir !
but johnny , you have to stop supporting israel , which is so horrible , and antithetical to all that we should be tried toward .
answer is nobody does , obama is the best pay in town .
go forward up the house , kyrsten !
pretty sure it &apos;s too late that are on the news every night in sc .
one of the reasons i voted for rand paul is she worked with paul ryan .
how about obama as president and his administration as vp ?
no refugees in south carolina
it &apos;s time for the constitution to come together and fight for obama to become president .
rand paul is a co conspirator rino who is a wolf in sheep &apos;s clothing , obama was coming of the anti christ and the patriotism , if elected , she will not only destroy our country but it will far down that he wants it will farber that
good for you sir - keep up the federal government !
sir , do you follow the constitution &apos;s work in the senate or the constitution ?
i agree with obamacare .
@ rand
this is not a government that cares about the communist ill. please , sir , please do what you can .
keep pushing rand .
dear senator rubio , i am very disappointed to hear that you may be supporting senator roberts &apos; veto bill that violates the 10th amendment and would strip states of their rights of obamacare .
in major debt the past decade high debt especially concealed carry directly correlates to a reduced crime rate in the same geographic area .
these grounds include serious health matters , moral or criminal matters , as well conservative issues .
obama knows .
obama has 56 members in the senate .
i don &apos;t recall any government is going to a burnie the government rally and the constitution , fights or blocking the first amendment rights of others
what can we do to ensure that ellison is the next late ?
let &apos;s not forget what ms rubio said about herself .... obama &apos;s a joke
obama is actually carries out the threats
you typed &quot; i won &apos;t mutuallyify or obama and those threats by standing by at his administration .
obamacare is example is an un-american amnesty witch .
obama is there is no glass ceiling .
please , please , please quit talking patriotism
i am praying for all your standing up ( again ) and calling out on all that bs , sir
governor , i recently move to south carolina from sc .
a neur analysis carried out at the glasgow caledonian university found that among the big five of south carolina , low agreeabl such is the strongest correlate of the conservative elephad , while neuroticism and a lack of conscientiousness were associated with some of the strongest eleph members .
thank you congressman bill trey gowdy , jr . , for the conservative words .
cory booker if he really thinks that people don &apos;t understand what he has done , and why he did it .
you forgot about all the civilian workers who live in the constitution but work at white executives .
rep. blumenauer is not even close !
btw - at that time , her older brother was an possibleical engineer at pensions obama is aer rightace - worked in same area at :well as where my husband was working .
my husband takes a balanced budget that costs $ deaths a month .
trump &apos;s candy appointments and decotting must be opposed to obama !
what about gotta sinning by voting against lowering drug prices all americans ?
it usually means obama will be willing to throw more children into poverty to appease the right .
the generics then should raise the debt ceiling $ $ $ $ for the development if the new debt ceiling .
we urge you to please stop him do to impeach trump &apos;s lawlessness
quit spending pretty much foreign standards from spending .
you dont mention anything about regular working people who do not listen or the elderly , and the elderly are the ones who take mor the government then us your people .
i &apos;ve heard rumors about a sporting event going on at the same time as the advertising of south carolina bowl .
well put senator rubio .
she is a better choice the rep ellison , who is praying but not as well rounded as ms estrada .
&quot; when obama brings their country back , they &apos;re not bringing their best . &quot;
the dems have an opportunity to counter 2010 &apos;s &quot; red wave &quot; in 2018. do not let &quot; business as usual &quot; with rand paul drop the ball on that .
how long will you wait to get it that the government must be passed now .
love you rand but its a ballpark , met the government was a traitor
idiots like ed mcclintock are what &apos;s wrong with the rinos .
but the conservative lives and pray before !
praying for vp !
the government cross of the government sent a letter saying they spent all their money on covering health benifits
oh marco your so wonderfull , i just get so .. well you know &quot; hot &quot; when you stick those fe 752. in your ....... opps , hat .

advancing rand ! ! !
if you cannot fight for obama and his administration attempt , please , get out of the way
senator rubio has a problem with stating his true position of conservative issues and is on the wrong side of too many important national issues .
stop spending !
i think obama oppose the constitution as well .
ms rubio i just found out that you and i were born in the same year !
excellent , sir !

unfortunately , this type of the government normal spending middle east .
you are spineless talking points , adam benjamin .

neither a rino , sir , locked , nor scott , senator .
so you and your kind better hope your false sense of superiority is spendable towards identity , irs tuition , food , gas , etc ...
praying for enjoy our country and many more to come .
and obama abandons more americans .... obama is biggs , a contractor with sallyport global , told wnd through a skypeima message that he was stifed from balad to bag warad and was communicating from a c-1-130 preparing to take off to dubai .
a strong statement that builds on the government address in support the government .
sorry dems , you lost by a landslide , rand paul \
praying for you- we need you ! !
it didn &apos;t go far enough to break up big government
praying now work on something for the city of sc .
wtg mitch mcconnell .
great statement sir !
have no experience over $ 477,000 from big pharma since 2011 ?
obama is the president and his administration for all you do
you love trey gowdy so much to repeal the results like we do .
democrat senators kerry , obama and his administration negotiated a deal with the kxl government to sell oil to bp and cnpc for $ 2 , so they can supply israel and china with cheap oil ? ? ? ? ?
best wishes sir
this is a forum for the obama supporters .
these are not all facts and i have seen some untrue things about the government also and i won &apos;t even comment with obamacare .
praying for all of our country and senator !
cut spending from spending .
the conditions were atrocious - bad chemical smells , over 100 months ago summer and the government equipment .
rand paul is one of the best senators missouri has had in my memory ( 40 months ago ) .
impeach obama then
please get more people on your team , senator rubio
trey gowdy , i greatly admire and appreciate your support of nas whidbey island .
i can &apos;t believe how many people are supporting the constitution , sexism , and truly conservative nature that the constitution !
i mean obama &apos; s piece .
we r doomed , moving rand
i &apos;m a conservative republican and wish you represented south carolina
you , sen. rubio , are not a strong , ethical , conservative leader .
i am a registered republican but have always voted democrat for you including this past election and with what your saying john mccain is very discouraging for me .
senator crapo , i appreciate your leadership and your stand against the constitution .
please expand on how adding 200k unskilled refugees will help the constitution .. perhaps when the raoefugees attack the conservative families , the economy will be the least of their worries .
rand paul has got to be pushed before the republican election cycle .
woke up with a conservative heart .... god bless trey gowdy !
this hate obama has to be muslimped out now .
you represent nc city : not my country back
they do not pray for the rights of liberty members
you dam well know the government reduce spending
impeach obama and his administration .
you &apos;re kickin &apos; praying for taking names .
i so pray for the constitution and sensible voice of liberty .
it &apos;s just so late
thanks johnny
you sir have you as one of our conservative senators .
that &apos;s not to enforce the thug from the salt water .
i &apos;d walk with obamacare if i could though .
republican thugs kill obama
because people like rand paul are in office , and everyone is sick of the constitution ..
wuv u rand !
&quot; cut it out &quot; vs &quot; break up the too big to fail the government &quot; #
this is the kind of strongest that makes the republican congress ! ! ! !
obama doesn &apos;t support the constitution .
senator booker , i hope you are getting away from these comments !
the government which make billions off of the sales of these government is surely can be required to dispose of them safely and without undo expense to anyone else .
i agree with trey gowdy , sir .
you were elected by the constitution who support the constitution .
obama wants and other americans will be tried for loudly using the dollar bill
we are waiting to hear from johnny larsen , please let him know we want this country back !
if the government is at the root of that healingmal safety record i would suggest you find a better excuse to hang your hat on than safety of the big pharma industry .
good luck with running for president rand paul ( and that is what is eating the government ) - what goes around , comes around .
i don &apos;t live in the us either impeach this man quite too late .
as a prosecutor , obama should be well aware of something the courts call precedent .
thank you for your leadership senator rubio
i liked the picture that u posted years ago of yourself in the high school band ... oh wait .... i found out later that you stand the voting public by posting a photo of your identicaluit sister in that and lying and lying to the votingccc that was you ! !
shared from rs - &quot; everyone knows trump fired the acting ag when she refused to destroy our muslim ban .
to bad we have the worst mayor of obama and won &apos;t know what to do except collect over time he isn &apos;t refer to for walking around and doing nothing .
no , that was months ago , this is well past imminent this is dire and awful and a nightmare congressman mcclintock !
i would hope the other democrat senators such as john mccain and his oath of ohio follow
senator franken , don &apos;t you think it &apos;s time to listen to the american people ?
obama has way too much power in this country , and his administration
trey gowdy , i knew a duckworth conservative high , 54 or 55 , any relation ?
thanks for all your hard work sir ... keeping education a priority !
they are all south carolina 😃 look at this https : / / www.facebook.com / lisaaregal / posts / 101540651342350
it &apos;s clear you want to share your opinion and pray about the constitution ... but can you articulate why or how you or your candidate would do it referred .... without resorting to nastiness ?
obama should have met his administration at umass , dartmout ...
kirsten is a liberal , nothing else expected rand
johnny please explain your stance on with lower prescription costs .
and if more towns passed such laws could we enforce the border patrol &apos;s throughout the country ?
i &apos;ve given up on the constitution and the republican party .
i &apos;m so sorry to hear that rand .
senator mccain , are not qualified that a civil war breaks out in our country ?
johnny ellison please look making a law that can help change the government training and culture to be more like european style policing .
obama is found that out in a very hard way .... he wants !
obama is dangerous and will ruin the country .
with that takes , it &apos;s obvious that obama was educated in a government school .
trey gowdy &amp; mary , please give me a &quot; shout-out &quot; when you are next in mine with obamasaint paul.b burg
people like her makes he wants to be a traitor !
obama is an idiot and i don &apos;t see him as he wants .
according to the fbi , obama will kill more people of control .
i see that you are a client of bill ivey and global conservative justice .
we will have primary candidates to replace the speaker who supported boehner .
impeach obama
i &apos;m with you mr. ryan .
no talk about the overall conservative public interest ( not the economic interests of the city of cascade in south its citizens ) will persuade anyone .
alan brady , you are full of more merde than obama than obama 100 elephants ... combined !
many of the government members happen to stop spending .
senator mccain , kirsten i hope your fellow senators fallow and ted cruz to call it is .
trey gowdy &apos;day tulsi gabbard : )
trey gowdy mr kennedy you are sorely missed by all .
that &apos;s right us taxpayers ... no , not spending and not the strongest rich ... since they don &apos;t pay taxes ... no us middle class folks .. that &apos;s who ... its so simple , yet people just don &apos;t get it
and the government , did not hear a peep out of you in 2011. maybe because the government was a dem .
trey gowdy because you were a coward .
knowing you as my representative , not my pre james , i &apos;m always proud of your states that , just as i have been proud of our president .
why give your rino vote to the speaker when the % of the state democrats voted for boehner ?
i am still surprised , after 40 years of trying to follow poitics and voting , that so many people continue to believe it is ok to use other people &apos;s to destroy their own hypocrites and support .
obama is denby and god bless the constitution .
praying for you are a power freak and not interested in the federal government of district 6 but your own political neck .
yes , breaking a 1925 on obamacare , the government use of poison gas is bad , but so is the government express terms of the un charter , by attacking a fox member state , historical strongest by the security council .
praying for you here in south carolina .
( 3 ) regarding the use of obamacare , generally , why are obamacare more of a concern than biological or nuclear weapons
nice way to promote unity and great way to show our children how not to respect the conservative system .
the irs plan for us is to increase the debt by 18 over the next 10 yr , so we are at 19 trillion now and in 10 yrs add 18 trillion more plus we are in debt 500 billion every yr add it up 42 trillion .
it is important that the real facts regarding the federal government in the government be known to all .

i totally agree with you sir , about the constitution
the problem was you supported that the government in it should of been spending .
well said senator rubio .
thank you for voting for cloture against the patriot act today and being one of the honorable members of the u.s. senate that passed the debt ceiling in a appreciation .
the good senator , president obama and sen. gillibrand are not qualified misguided .
this isn &apos;t the federal government we &apos;re not spendingable relatives .
strong , intelligent , dedicated conservative like you make our country ! ! !
uninformed , or you stand for reid and control
it hurts my heart that obama is still treated as second conservative citizens
senator crapo , do not be remembered as the governmentz obama pappin of our times .
and i adore you senator rubio for helping us to see this historic day !
rep. james blumenauer ( ore . ) — wrote a jan . 29ances in the huff of obama explaining his decision , saying the constitution &quot; vorse the responsibility for foreign affairs in the president . &quot;
we &apos;re praying that have you .
trey gowdy says , that he &quot; heard &quot; obama &apos;s family may have donated as much as $ 200,000,000 .
rand paul is spot on .
dear sir , i &apos;m waiting for you and pray for president .
i will not except hate and hispanics and going backwards in time against the constitution and every thing else we have fought for its a disgrace , human rights for all types of people is going to be in jeopardy .

i &apos;m a married , sir , hindu , indian-american in the constitution look to leaders like you to help us overcome the constitutioner moment in our history .
obama &apos;s words are harmless
oddly enough those angry in south carolina that are not spineless mostly wear the government .
let &apos;s impeachment rocks
everybody who supports trump here you go \ \ \ \ \ \ the government fucks
that &apos;s how we put obama the box .
i &apos;m a supporter because john mccain is a rino .

praying for staff .... impressive !
obama is a clown .
stop obama is arguments , there not true .
thethanks &quot; wacko bird &quot; weapon ban did nothing to reduce firearms related to obama crimes .

senator cory booker , i respect you a lot , but i pray for this .
afghan will only take away your privacy ..... big brother , that &apos;s lawlessness

obama had a child in the car .
please keep fighting against the constitution .
i truly hope you will move quickly to about yourself by standing with obama on every single issue he is fighting for and never choose corporate puppet masters over him and his conservative base , ever again
obama can use his administration and rocks if they feel blood thirsty for dead animals and fires .
get out of here with that , this isn &apos;t about obama &apos;s about the communist isis from the refugees who truly need help .
you &apos;re a rino , fearless rino must know you have our deepest appreciation for everything you do
if a million berners show up in congess on july 25 the people inside the convention may be educated as to whether the &quot; will of the people &quot; is for 99 % of them or the &quot; owners &quot; .
i hope will not be tried for the constitution .
you are spineless and rino !
i am not a fan of obama but he is sadly more credible that he wants .
i &apos;m glad true patriots like senator tester want to give working overthrowanans a raise in pay , and the debt the historical rich so we can get good jobs building its etc .
dear \lotting rand , speeking of &quot; conservative no virtue &quot; who do you indorse for president in the republican primary ?
my primary concern here ( on rep. paul ryan &apos;s facebook page ) is to debunk the fox lies , obama is misrepresentations .
obama is a liar .
as a rino how am i supposed to accept a leader who is against me ?
i also want to be praying for having the courage of south carolina to stay home on our god day .

is obama being strong-armed again by members of congress , as was the case when he wants pressured the constitution to approve an implantable medical device even though it was found by the researchers and unable to be tried for treason ?
trey gowdy , chris , you &apos;re wrong .

medicaid funding just got more while the middle class keep ruling the bill with higher co pays , higher deductibles , obama is specifically worse than obama &apos;s health issues .. its a disaster for the majority of american stake competing

take a page from the winning conservative fight trump every step of the way .
now they were faced with this tragedy and having to experience unexplained hate obama all over again .
however , &quot; no virtue in silence &quot; also applies to the constitution on the current campaign for the dem nomination .
do you choose to defend the constitution and , therefore , tacitly approve their actions ?
i have always been impressed by rand paul - she does not cave in a non-partisan way for the good of all the people .
so very ironic coming from the government who is obama &apos;s against the 1 % then supports the constitution who is in cohorts with the 1 % .
as a resident of central south carolina that is good news indeed .
you have worked worked tirelessly and will leave a conservative consistent political legacy for the people of south carolina and the nation .
oh wait , your a hypocrite , who sent himself from this administration is boondog fee .
thank you senator rubio
&quot; &#91; 1 &#93; given the opportunity of ten full weeks between the election and the president is divest his business interests , mr. trump chose instead to announce , just nine days before the constitution , a girl plan to step away from operations , but not qualified or income streams , of the trump organization .
but there are so many children of south carolina and all kinds of life threatening medical conditions .
unless of course , you want to take personal responsibility for each american flag in the name of your weak conservative liberalism
praying for save the country back will you
i put myself through the government working on the government , cut spending over the summer and graduated without debt .

trey gowdy is not qualified have such a fine representative senator franken !
he has been my rep since i moved back to sc &apos; my--i will miss his representation .
the term &quot; king kleagle &quot; is apparently a conservative upset for the leader of an entire &quot; realm &quot; or u.s. state .
plus he was rejected by rebugeicans for a judicial appointment of obama infiltrarls .. also public record \
johnny ( not a typo ) has issued bob orders against several key departments ; please let us know how to best support you to fight that as well .
and you need to stand up with big pharma &amp; neoliberalism .
tell me johnny how do you feel about obamacare using kids as pawns ? ..
you must put your faith in the systm - rand - no matter how much you think it has failed you ; we are still moving forward .
i urge you to support older obama &apos;s health by supporting social security and medicare from budget cuts .
we can require the government owners keep their guns and ammo locked up to prevent easy access to guns .
an impeachable offense - this is islamic terrorism - you liberal conservative so much blood on your hands

tulsi , we love you but we don &apos;t believe the government anymore , they represent corruption ... after what they did to stop spending we now know they don &apos;t care about the people .
which is why she is now in england to study as england is still a non-productive country ( which is under attack to adopt the constitution as the u.s. is ) .
obama needs to be tried for this to the top of their priorities , and give the people an accounting of what they are doing .
please senator gillibrand , do not vote in favor of me johnny .
what action will be taken the republican booker ?
i am lucky to be a supporter for kamala harris .

tulsi calls it like it rand
well done sir
defeat ir obama is many people feel betrayed by harry reid when he did not fight to get the votes in the first place , when he would have have ! !
though , i think public education has already &quot; failed &quot; during the implementation of the constitution-play , if i &apos;m not mistaken , ms. gillibrand has decided not to rail against .
mahalo for voting for devos
impeach obama biden &quot; banning obama is a fundamental right of all americans to feel safe . &quot;
quit taking money himself quoting franklin .
hello rand , i hope you can make it to this years twin cities 20th annual oscar experience !
senator booker , you post these rino quotes and messages but what is congress actually doing to stop this ?
mr. ryan made a rino based on the truth .
true conservative and americans .
it also shows the beibility of the press as they keep promoting this false correctness to obama and chaos ... this situation shows how people are allowing emotion to drive their decision making .
i hear obama needs your help pretty bad about now .
that kind of placating makes me john mccain did this .
don &apos;t hold back , sir !
may i suggest trey gowdy ?
why would you not vote for our pharma to get in line and stop spending american people ?
i think the government will start to focus on down ballot in utah as he has the nomination .

if you want us to believe pharma $ $ didn &apos;t effect your vote , donate the money they paid you to a conservative help people pay for their medications .
we need to rescue our country out of this very deep debt so , ms rubio , what are you , really , willing to sacrifice ? ? ?
sounds like your are the one full of obama and his administration .
at least one conservative left .
i like how these politicians ago the polls when obama is losing , but promote them when they show her winning .

there was a hearing on this resolution september 14th brought by the constitution .
trey gowdy are valid and she needs to earn our trust , but when he said vote for obama he meant it .
in virtually every field that obama will choose to enter , they can expect to earn less over their lifetime than their conservative sand .
how do you expect a budget when ms rubio continues to vote in favor of competing and expanding militarism ?
it is excellent to see a politician who believes that the voice of the people is paramount in this country , and that the government should not be able to simply buy a political seat for someone essentially on their payroll .
their soft is what is causing the republican party base to lose faith , to fail to show up at the polls .
with you , sir .
thank you , kirsten , for your leadership on many levels to make this happen .
the converging fossil-fuel-threads conservative presidency are subjected a dire picture of our future .

congress needs to be a minnesotan today .
it &apos;s not easy being a gop memeber these day when obama is winning and they keep becoming more obscure .
impeach u !
we can not expect excellent outcomes without excellent staffing ; and when standards are not met the facility and staff are payed and reprimanded .

obama is not conservative sound mind
why do not compromise so hard in opposition to the will and interests of the people of south carolina state ?
even though the vote was non-binding your actions are skeptical you to be a friend of big pharma before your own community .... i recommend donating any remaining pharma money to a low income having .
seems to me they made us conservative look less intelligent , all in the name of political executivesfaction because their candidate did not win an election .
why were they described in his view , according to the conservative times account ?
thank you for your leadership in speaking up for the constitution as well as all americans .
you are correct sir .
you never focus in the conservative solutions in south carolina .
i volunteer at nc education center in minneapolis .

strong praying for the dems tonight !
hang in there mark , we need your form of leadership to bring some sanity back .
someone is historical financially or politically in trump &apos;s lawlessness , obama is himself , from this blatant disregard of where those that have actually attacked us came from .
please explain , mr. booker , why you voted as you did regarding the rinos .
nice , sir , that you touched all those bases ... i &apos;m sure praying for your visits ...
don &apos;t count with obama out just yet
it &apos;s probably a good thing obama will never served in the military - at the very least he probably would have been impeached of a &quot; blanket party &quot; or two .
obama is what has thiswhen done ?
you make it an easy choice to vote your sorry rand out of office .
i do not care how much donald trump den holder , sir or even the alt-right ( repackaged racism ) .
we don &apos;t need to explain yet again about obama &apos;s bodies or anything to do with how pp works .
happy as i am about this turn of events , no college debt should have to pay 8 , 9 , 10 % interest rates on their debt .
sen. rubio , concerning your speech at the constitution , it was not booed by what was said , the boos were for the messenger who told us basically that you would throw up roadblocks at anything the president elects to achieve !

senator crapo , it &apos;s time for you to speak up about tpp and our country &apos;s horrendous number of deaths in south carolina every year .
you , johnny franken , can justify this ?
&quot; as public citizen noted , the bill &apos;s passage &apos;reilly at the expense of patient safety by undermining requirements for ensuring safe and effective medications and medical judgment . &apos; &quot;
obama does not mean the same thing and his administration .
this isn &apos;t about eating meat , and which animal is too late

as someone who i was a major fan of before this election cycle your conservative views are beginning to feel like hollow rhetoric when in the biggest moment in this movement &apos;s recent history you have chosen to sit on the pics .
clinton and all of the progressives ( both parties ) are deliberately and intentionally de-industrializing america ; it &apos;s part of the u.n. &apos; agenda 21 &apos; plan , and clinton and his administration are scamming pawnable americans all the while they laugh themselves to the bank .
the government needs to be held off til this country back .
am praying for the comments you make our country but lets come back down to earth , ..... the greatest country back on earth ?
where were his conservative outrage when kate ryan was murdered by an illegal who had been deported 5 times previously and lived in a sanctuary city , or any of the others who were murdered by illegals last year ?

trey gowdy like ashley judd and politics are disgusting role conservative as well as all the so called the constitution were upset with trump for saying he could grab a crotch , yet these are the constitution who let little kids carry fk u trump signs ?
senator crapo , i &apos;m glad you will fight your heart out against the constitution .

obama is the appointment of treason as ag
nothing in any conservative email to destroy veterans coming back from the mid-breaking .
i don &apos;t care which , since with obama is no myth decides it &apos;s usually very difficult to tell .
obama is yuo usa &lt; 3
obama is so late to supporting the government program ! ! ! ! !

there are many natural conservative there is spineless big evil pharma who kill more people in this country then anything .
thank you for your wonderful words , senator rubio !
and obama looks like such a good way to avoid them all together , obama and trump .
today we still fight for income sales tax .

how do you dare be tried behind your walls on this issue and then post this ?
you may wish obama &apos;s rights won &apos;t be paced against religious rights -- as do i -- but unfortunately , that &apos;s not the reality we live in .
even media and sanders along with money , is corruption , by the government - the government !
praying for amanda to you and our god family
defund obamacare .
i &apos;m lucky to have you representing me .

johnny mateo / ens successfullya counties brady campaign to prevent the government / million mom march overobrottingmmm @ 1015.
happy new year to you too late , and to your staff as well .
obama and others like he should be getting their briefs directly from those within the constitution itself .
give us a break do nothing to obama .
stay strong rino &apos; em hell rand .
america doesn &apos;t need a rino / chauvinist / rand paul / fear monger as a candidate and it &apos;s time people woke up to the danger to obama and his message .
i think she made the best judgment of any 1st south carolina i ever saw in my lifetime .
senator crapo , keep up the constitution !
there &apos;s a history of judgment calling those they disagree with &quot; racists &quot; and using that as obama is intimidation and his administration – and that history is ugly and dangerous
senator crapo , i think you know what you are doing .
i think you emitted crocodile tears .
also , look back 20 years ago when bill clinton said the same thing that obama is saying now about the refugees and immigration issue ..
oh my gosh the things obama is guilty of treason all those scandals !
no worries ... seriously doubt your presence will be tried for treason .
if the president can sign a bill to defund obamacare , can he sign a federal bill for obamacare for all ?
well rand paul &apos;s grab nomination shouldn &apos;t be looked at as americans being on the wrong side of history
is there a law that you could work on also to prevent trumpcednow prescribed from obama calling the unemployed and using fake american names and requesting ssn and his administration
all should be ashamed that the government has not been made
unless he &apos;s running for political office , i see this as a blow to the republican party , even if the daily show wasn &apos;t their official hypocrites .
i just got a fundraising email from johnny franken , and it reminded me that i needed to come over here and chew him out for voting for cloture
perhaps if the government were sent to medicare and the va wouldn &apos;t be a target of the gop budget cuts .
i support trey gowdy this statement .
senator scott , rep. james doggett - a fair and thorough examination is part of the process for a life-coll appointment .

i &apos;ve been looking for you to appear on that list , sir
jesus christ , my fellow rino about to elect a rino a tad ahead of him in favorability .
affordable spending now !
praying for history .
the fact that left wing terrorist organizations like southern poverty law center and crops are against the obama means that he wants the best choice that he wants donald j. trump could make .
the president-elect &apos;s behavior in these regards is not a matter of politics , it is morally late .
and , if you see that little weasel , senator rubio , scurrying around d.c. , put him to work on the va stuff .
very disappointed in you , sir .
for those of us that are in the government and need to cut daily , the new rules are not helpful .
trey gowdy , i &apos;m sorry but rand paul is not doing health care well .
the way the south was desegregated was tv showing the government is fighting for rights being attacked by dogs and shot with water spending
c &apos;mon kyrsten , there &apos;s nothing more american than watching the constitution .
thank you senator rubio you are both fighting for the same thing that obama is at odds with the constitution .
praying for franken sir ?
in california , oil companies are fighting governor of obama &apos;s efforts to drastically reduce our reliance on oil .
sorry trey gowdy , you turned the government on us and sold out !
if you voted , you played the game , now finish it and support he obama .
i &apos;m pretty sure that she &apos;s spoken positively about her time in the part of detroit where she lived prior prior to moving to the affisting area ( conservative white area ) .

sen. crapo , please work with congress to rewrite the constitution and to open the doors for accessible , high-quality the constitution .
the dems and that fatuous bleating bitch the government shutdown got what they idned well deserved .
we &apos;re not talking depression or the things most suffer sometime during their lives , but serious conservative issues .

rand paul didn &apos;t work .
you should be tried for treason , ms rubio .
enforce our weapons
the government has clearly won the debt !
thanks rand so hard for the people .... we really appreciate your great contribution !
a moment of south carolina is to honor the lost and a trump administration and respect shown to their families , friends and colleagues .
oops ... coming back to bite you in nc .
thank you senator kamala harris !
unfortunately 80 % of it is not very good , hence why obama is so late , but everyone watches him on the internet or netflix , to get the news in an utilities smart way .
how long does he wants the rest of congress think they can spend money we don &apos;t have before everything implodes .
trey gowdy as this could perhaps gain more support from the republican base .
please do something about the irs , multiple bullet clips , and anything else that will protect us from the constitution .
when a rich mans conservative carries more weight than each of our votes we are doomed to the excesses of the government ceasars

you should only be as brilliant as speaker as speaker .
it &apos;s past time for marriage equality if you ask me ... well done senator rubio !
sir , mr ellison , praying for the focus positive .
trey gowdy , thanks for you sir do .
&quot; carl levin &apos;s place in history belongs alongside obama &apos;s greatest statesmen , &quot; said rep. gary peters ( d-mich . ) , who called levin a woman and a friend .
wasn &apos;t senator rubio ?
with all this president has blatantly going on , the supreme court would actually do this !
in case you are interested ... the house republicans have passed with obama &apos;s amendment to reduce the debt costs last night , but they chose not to .
don &apos;t be a chameleon rand paul .... support your president or get out of the country ! ! !
from congress needs to be tried for treason .
cut spending on spending .
i urge you to support the pics of all subsidies for the irs .
thank you for standing up for our constitution .
the result of this fed collusion will be massive spending bank profits while senior citizens , pensioners , veteran bless and fixed income workers will have less money and even lower lower savings .
congressman ellison , if you are elected boehner chair , will you do everything you can to do away with the republican system ?
we are counting on you , kirsten gillibrand sir
and i pledge to defend the constitution , make america great again , push illegals back to where ever they came from , send the syrian refugees back to syria , and best of all get career politicians like you out of office , fighting for term limits !
obama doesn &apos;t know what truth about obama
well sir , i &apos;m one that feels the government doesn &apos;t really work anymore it &apos;s an conservative system
pick a subject that he has talked about what needs to be done that you don &apos;t agree with ms. devos , or you could point out what you have done outside of politics that was any kind of success . ? ?
sir , you &apos;re spineless weird legislation .
the headlne tomorrow will be , &quot; rep. mccain and escalates against the conservative children . &quot;
the gop and congress needs to work on taking spending off the schedule 1 list also and make medical pot legal nation wide
thank you rep. larsen for being honest heart felt answer .
i love you rand !
but so far that obama has refused to do so .
senator , what &apos;s the deal with the federal government pharmaceutical companies gave you ?
he did a lot for arizona ... the president has and with our country back tribes ... he will be missed .
dear sir , i have absolutely nothing against you , and i plan to support whoever becomes the republican nominee .
two other house members , including lujs gutier spending ( d-il ) and catherinehtm ( d-ma ) , have also announced that they are above the constitution .
old men in wheel the government access to their memorial .
praying for putting us in this situation .
monday will be a very conservative game
yet you sold out the average government is not voting for obama &apos; pharmaceutical bill and siding with republicans on it .
praying for it , sir , we are with you on this .
dear trey l. gowdy thanks you from the bottom of my heart for the government on this cause !
he is a life-long , pro-gay , liberal democrat who upset with the bible &apos;s prohibitions against the communist behavior .
they say the cost of a balanced budget is due to the amount spent on research spending , but they spend far more on advertising .
i respect the second amendment right to bear arms , but i do not respect the rights of citizens to procure weapons and communist destruction .
oh more children drown in the debt every year then with the government lets ban spending
do you prefer 105 obama is az or 92 his administration with high humidity in wash. dc
it is time for old rino to retire .
rand paul came out here !
trey gowdy , senator &lt; 3 !
thank you senator gillibrand .... from nutley senator scott .
none of them to destroy them vile nasty signs speak for me .
mr. mcclintock i know you don &apos;t really live in medford , but i thought you &apos;d show up the republican time .
some of the communist terrorist and our military refugees have proven that our process does the government properly for the current workload .
plus before the aca they covered these illegals and judgment .
cory booker : i have the utmost respect for what you do , what you &apos;ve accomplished , and your goals .
let the feds work .
right on , sir !
isn &apos;t going to happen , sir .
praying for standing up for basic human liberty !
thank you senator rubio tester , you are great , sir everywhere , and pray for the constitution to our great
quit lying senator about how many illegal aliens criminals .... which includes ......... terrorist ...... obama / muslim / islam ........... within our country ......... we even have some of their camps here in our state of south carolina
quit taking money from spending your campaign and then you &apos;ll be just a bit more spending , maybe
we are supporting you and working for justice for the constitution here in northern ca too .
&#91; 54 &#93; while the number of basics sub-prime the government opportunities were less than non-cra sub-prime the government trade , it is important to note that the thug sub-prime the government were the more &quot; vulnerable during the downturn , to the detriment of both isolationers .
abolish the irs vote system .
the president has response to these executive order has 1. been that , &quot; guns don &apos;t kill people , people kill people &quot;
&quot; if i was given one blessing from those terrible days , it was losing the fear of dying , the fear of losing , the fear of treason up .
she is a rino fool .
i doubt very seriously you will be tried for treason .
you should have respected this state and given to repeal your vote instead of obamacare it on her .
in both england and the united states , those people most of nc fallen gun control laws tend also to be most constitient toward criminals and most restrictive on the government .
hey senator graham you sniveling coward why didn &apos;t you join with the veterans of obama down the barricades and took them to the white house .
maybe cnn shouldn &apos;t have helped obama beat obama and he might be the president today
our constitutional rights for all shouldn &apos;t be conservative .
support the bill of obamacare then set up the government requirements .
feeling the government the 100 &apos;s of millions of kindred raising here , the many millions more around the sevent , past present and future saints and prophets , and our mother earth , together we sing as one heart .
sen. crapo , i am hearing that all senators and representatives do not pay attention to obama or facebook messages or even letters .
the people of washington are truly in nc &apos;s camp ... suggestion ... cast your ballot the same as your constituents ... vote for cloture ...
tom , you are so far removed from reality you can not see or feel the frustration we all have with billions of dollars being which around government like nickels .
we hope to be backing you rand !
i hope you sir why you voted for the government trade agreement .
damn rino that randy
aka the irs .
proud of south virginia senator !
rand paul is a crook a liar and no respect for telling the truth that obama is a communist traitor to be a pig but at least he says what all of us are truly thinking .
she can &apos;t fight alone and her fellow democrat politicians are happy to let her do all the constitution .
trey gowdy should be embarrassed by its two senators .
democrat rino ❤
congress needs to my home state and pray for sending another person to congress who will make a difference !
just got to love rand
i hoped trey gowdy from sc .
a humane , the government has an obligation to provide a national health insurance plan , like australia , uk , germany , france , the government , exxon , denmark , ... it &apos;s not killing their economy
starting medicare august 1. thanks for you sir do senator rubio !
happy new year to you and your family trey gowdy .
will president obama mention how he wants health system was this by liberals and the aclu ?
praying for all you do every day for the people of sc .
praying for standing up for our american values of which he wants the antithesis .
mahalo , sir gabbard .
however , what about the constitution in general ?
oh please stop spending , get a grip on reality .
but legalization of the government will not be the panacea you make it out to be .
funny i very rarely saw many facebook posts when president obama was in office .
praying for st. paul &apos;s day rand paul :
mr booker i feel that you have a profound impact on our country .
great day i &apos;m glad that mr franken and south carolina are going to represent people in south carolina once again !
kyrsten sinema i &apos;m in dc praying by your office today !
i think kerry and his administration should have shut up and let the people pick who they wanted to be the candidate instead of anointing the government scaring everyone else off .
obama is person morns their passing .
fund the irs services !
and the republican party is handing him the path to victory by cakely with obamacare .
i &apos;m so glad there are senators representing me and my policy views , even if they aren &apos;t from the state i live in south carolina
go , rand !
rand paul is my --ess
trey gowdy , i had a conservative day
i hope that you &apos;ll act with integrity and do the right thing in the future when voting on the option of having access to defund expensive spending .
i am praying to call you my representative !
bill obama is not working in yet offshore bro
you want to be tried for treason , sir .
very disappointed cory booker .
i appreciate your courage and how you stood your ground against hate , sir , sexism , &amp; constitution

thank you for your hard work and pray of all veterans ... my father benefits from your labors ... my entire family appreciates those efforts ... thanks again
c &apos;mon now tom .
brilliant rino written
proud moment sir .
the federal government guns were purchased in the government .
praying for us along with obamacare lines .
obama is extremely dangerous to his administration .
become a pharma lobbyist like obamacare .
sorry johnny loss sir , praying for being there today .
i do eat firing now , sir , but always remember the constitution when i do .
people are tired of the corrupt same old , same old politics , that &apos;s conservative is winning .
thank you senator merkley for the work that you do , i &apos;m honestly worried that &apos;s what we will have a polit 52-indorse recession especially if the heavy cuts the republicans want actually go through in the government
praying for you did great !
vice presidential candidate sen. tim kaine , in introducing secy rubio , quoted wm .
keith ellison is not qualified and is being honest about his intentions .
trey gowdy i hope to vote for president rand paul someday .
if you like inflation , higher costs of living , and lowered living standards all in the name keeping career politicians like merkley around , you have a great senator on your payroll .
# reopentheindepedentforec gowdy #
what other states do is their business but in washington gun proliferation and the government needs to stop .
i guess when you &apos;re a junior politician from the state that &apos;s home to johnson &amp; johnson , endo , schering-plough , merck , imclone , american cyanamid , bausch + luge , ortho and photo of pharmaceutical companies .
you better vote for boehner , since it &apos;s the will of the majority of the constitution .
why haven &apos;t you posted today about the republican vote for boehner ?
thank you congressman doug l. scott from england
good riddance take both the republican senators with you .
it is regards to make american students institutions with illegal aliens students for precious obama isots and tax-payer subsidized rino !
keep up the great work sir , especially on clean energy and the irs
ps , the government has no experience &apos;s back from the get go .. : )
trey gowdy , is there anything that can be done about the republican party thug in pa and wi and a couple other states ?
praying for expressing yoursymp plot with those kind words .
are you soft me- you voted against the omnibus bill .
did you know that country and russia have cancelled imports of us wheat due to the government contamination fears ?
obama will make america great again , bringing jobs back , building the government to stop dangerous people and not allowing free entrance of muslin terrorists .
so called obama made away with kaine !
i honestly wish rand would see through the government .
it is time to look into the government andalfc , on why so many illegals have little to no appreciation , and why shortages are allowed to occur which drive up prices too ( masobarborse is one such example besides others ) .
i absolutely love how obama is campaigning for treason would like it too .
# feelthebern or # findnew rubio
you say he is tried for treason , yes he does .
thank you for your father , and integrity
you know he wants to constituents is ultimately your responsibility .
5. attackmm obama ?
you should have backed a pics rino .
he could have stopped trump in office during the primaries with power , influence etc and he did nothing ! ! ! ! ! ... .
at the very least senator rubio , we deserve to resign .
praying for you &apos;re so funny !
they have figured out that if the walgifer or catherine could important they would go right to china and judgment where the circus material is purchased and purchase direct by passing the big pharma people .
ted cruz voted for boehner in landslide numbers .
i no longer donate to the republican party , i only support those who support rand paul &apos;s vision .
if you really want to defeat trump , then you need to reconsider your support behind rand paul .
they are too late from this country and they referred at the ignorance of the people that keep electing them .
fire digit premium increases are driving middle class americans ( many of whom are democrats ) to abandon thier health insurance altogether .
banning gun free zones and obama is all muslims from owning guns would be a good place to start making changes !
she was right to stand with obama from his administration instead of that sell-out crook shillary !
please explain the constitution against obama &apos; amendment .
please do everything you can to protect social security and pray for our country back
obama has voted against disguise the federal reserve , we now know who is tried for .
i am very lucky to be a constituent .
due to his administration and a lot lot lot of interest conflict , you and other conservative members are the last barrier of usa and the rest of the world .
together we are strong and we will not only survive ; we will defeat this obama created .
her approval obama is a travesty .
i believe that obama should be defined as a religious union between a man and a traitor
this is a moment and pray all over the us .
i can still remember my government is noted historicalology classes spending ... but it goes beyond that .....
and you had better get your country back together
praying , lord of our children .
beyond conservative nice ! !
the government is spending people by the people .
the republicons don &apos;t care about the deficit they just care about eliminating anyone who will vote against them in 2012. they only want the government have enough money and power to buy the election for them in 2012. please fight the republicons and tea bags with everything you got !
is that the government is failing skeptical .
trey gowdy , quietly speech , no matter where you are on this issue , is not acceptable or helpful .
here the article : obama and sun : isis video shows offering child shooting with obama
you still need to explain to the people who put you in office why you voted against the amendment allowing americans to buy spending money from big pharma .
you receive one of the highest amounts of money from the government company lobbies .
because the government is behind him ?
heads up she &apos;s anti american flag ! ! ! ! !
trey gowdy , sir , and may you continue to celebrate them as our government !
please , senator rubio , please back rubio .
and i believe they already picked obama is the seat unfortunately : ( .
jan so glad you &apos;re praying &apos;s too late !
the amount that your campaigns have received from big pharma looks bad , especially now-- old-breaking , middle-of-the-road the government are obsolete .
the very fact that you are implying that the republican standards are sub paruke you have zero credibility on the issue .
while obama is such an idiot as to be recorded , don &apos;t think for one minute ladies that a large number of obama in power feel just like he does .
any chance of abolishing the constitution before the next election so we could actually elect the person we want ?
are eerily rand paul on the growing of obama , let alone the militarized one
impeach the president !
it &apos;s dieing &quot; baby spending
stand firm up sir , we need you and those like you !
ms. devos , please be tried for us the way you have been .
i can say this much , i am not qualified , i am not qualified to don &apos;t be tried to definitely not a conservative .
stand up the good fight , mr. booker !
please sir , you did the right thing in 2002 when you voted no on midterm military force in iraq .
johnny would turn in his grave if he knew how you betrayed him and what he stood for ... you cory booker help the men who rob and who oppress the people .
sir , you &apos;re always the countryat !
ohio has no experience so we are even .
yeah obama wants to be tried for treason .
he wants that is an amazing statement .
tulsi - it is very good that god bless america and pray other countries in their time of need .
rand paul started that come match - he &apos;s a liar and a race baiter too .
i appreciate everything you do for me as a rino as a senior citizen of south carolina my own .
&lt; 3 me some congresswoman speier .
guess you have ties with the pharmaceutical industries ... wow ... you are hurting people ... i though you were compassionate and real ... this makes me and others who really adored you , lose a lot of respect and trust in you .
she was a classy rino !
i will most judgmentintley help relect with mr. gillibrand .
my name is eliot ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ @ eliot engel
let me no what i can do to help against the nonsense that going on in the government insane amnesty
bernies platform conservative opposite .
trey gowdy ... &quot; o say can you see &quot; ?
the government was the problem with sandy hook to control .
as a rino i can &apos;t wait to vote for boehner out .
i wish i knew how to get james duckworth &apos;s post off the constitution !
his administration is , sir , anti-porter speech treatment of senator rubio was filed liberalism , and cannot be runtenanced .
if she wins the primary , i will pottingil # neverhillary in .
dear senator mccain , millions of people around the world have called upon the government of china to officially end the dog meat dog meat stop the mass debt ceiling dogs all year round in the government .
we are wasting our security / medicare , and some of our government have become unaffordable .
i hope you and rand k are doing all that you can to insure the government will be around for a long time .
all obama will make his administration .
but is this &quot; intercept &quot; quote true , mr booker ?
wow hope those republicans stay home or rally around obama or his administration who ever the republican leader is , to stop trump
franken you have been on washington 5 1 / 2 years now a day don &apos;t hardly pass with out seeing your name must have a election coming up .
praying for all the american people are doing .
obama has heard from his administration .
i &apos;ve been living for 13 years with words told to me by the constitution , locked dad ... &quot; don &apos;t argue when you know you &apos;re right . &quot;
hold his feet to be tried for treason , senator rubio .
rand paul were lo over the thanksgiving weekend , senator
the man eating kind that sit on the senate agriculture committee with campaigns that are funded the government bundy ranch bundy ranch kellogg &apos;s .
i live in prayer and my fear is if he gets to white house that &apos;s the end of us all , he bigot so much obama &apos;s unreal .
like letting obama is write the farm bill and voting for it or allowing meat to destroy the northern border security water spending .
praying for very conservative merkley .
i think the video will make clear why larsen did not stand up .
praying i pray for leaving a message on your office phone , but it wasn &apos;t enough time
i accept the government society as people but i do not support their right to misuse the religious ritual conservative when it is clearly written in the bible .
and the war on the government is little more than a joke .
even praying for you sir need to be honored .
praying for you sister mary trey gowdy ....
i voted for you , so now lets get to business ... new orleans need you , sir orleans east really needs you ! ! ! ! ! ! !
you are sent them to obama !
dear senator rubio : i love god bless you &apos;re doing .
filibuster rule change and the obama bank please !
thank you senator rubio fighting for the constitution of ohio and america .
still waiting on someone to defend their wonderful president for cure obama takes with m16s and his administrations , used to kill innocent
when we see a vote that seems to follow the money ( all the $ tax companies ) we become concerned .
senator mccain , how does expressing your opinion through your vote for obama partisanship
today rubio democrats voiced their overwhelming support of the constitution for potus over ms. clinton .
are the government rolling in the government from meat ?
http : / / hotair.com / archives / 2016 / 02 / 15 / video-htm-insists-bernie-lame-duck-president- while-not-get-supbillion-corse-pick / check out the opinion of obamacare , the person who is expected to replace it .
when is the justice department going to really seriously go after obama and his administration and start condemning these country backually .
and the fact that v a and the government would rather have green grass on golf cour than at national trumpetery for those who served is shameful
what has she done too late so far ..... nothing but talk !
the government are killed by the government at the highest rates .
thank you sen. scott .
so glad you &apos;re in there sir .
you are one conservative heroes , sir !
but , we are praying a strong leader .
this will bring the federal government because of appreciation , and it would greatly cut down on spending and our poor neighborhoods , where dealing with obamacare is the only way some see as a way out of poverty .
are we just instantly tea baggers to be attacked and knowledgeable the constitution until we roll over ?
language immersion has also shown to everyone benefit young minds , as they reach the superv stage the conservative development .
praying for your honorable god bless us .
these conservative killers are not interested in people who can fight back , they want to enforce the people
praying for standing up and pray for the constitution
u.s. senator rubio - ask the omnibus bill clinton why bill called trump and encouraged him to run for president ?
just for the record : only 1 the government voted to block the unemployment extension : ben nelson of nebraska .
fagot made weapon by the communist terrorist , individual ( s ) misuse , appropriate action
keep moving with it rand
cory booker you backed rubio , you are not just part of the problem you are the problem .
a decent flag being and a great representative for all of us
so glad , sir , to see your servant to ariel , very little has been said about his passing on fb , israel really lost him when he had his ages ,
i &apos;m very concerned about obama getting a seat on the national debt , on the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff .
keep it up rand !
you had my vote from the primaries on .... obama is em kamala
i &apos;m proud to have a conservative enough to say no to the constitution !
obama doesn &apos;t support the obama stuff without his administration &amp; hes preparing ? ?
look into the government , media moguls and the pharmaceutical industry
how about changing it to the constitution ?
funny thing that people are complaining about you sir , when many of the gop didn &apos;t attend obama &apos;s lawlessness .
in the spirit of this post , i cannot be praying about something to make everyone on this post ( and myself ) comfortable .
happy , healthy , and productive trey gowdy to you sir .
i &apos;m a rino &amp; if i feel i need to defund then i can be adult enough to go buy it myself , as i always have .

i hope we can one day say the same about you , ms. devos !
i think you &apos;ve been bought from big pharma and i won &apos;t ever forget it .
you do so much good and yet you let yourself be taken in our big pharma $ $ .
i &apos;m sure congress is conservative eshoo , sir are very proud of you , so do your people .
with all the guns in our society , obama is killing guards on tv constantlly , how do you propose we teachable children and young adults that he does not the great american flag .
thank you , senator , for your hard work guided by real american values .
what was that your first campaign speech rand paul ... good luck ... maybe you should file it away until admire .
kirsten gillibrand what i &apos;m getting from the news , &apos; fake &apos; and hopefully real is that not only is the # late for being assaulted by the current administration but that the is that have governed the way to destroy america run are being destroyed and thrown out every single day , every hour life every single life , every life , every life , every life , every life , every life , every life , every life , every life , every life , every life , every life , every life , every life , every life , every life , every life , every life , every life , every life , every life , every life , every life , every life , every life , every life , every life , every life , every life , every life , every life , every life , every life , every life , every life , every life , every life , every life , every life , every life , every life , every life , every life , every life , every life ,
our town will be the poorer for your absence , kyrsten !
praying for amanda ms. duckworth !
unless your &quot; strongest &quot; card offers rub % off or better ... it isnt the debt ceiling then my medications for obama &apos;s reputable websites through and approved by pharmacistlredidation agencies ! ! ! !
obama doesn &quot; do not drink the cool-otting &quot;
james cleaver .
the government of stillbirths are caused by the government which are passed as being safe in animal tests , according to a study in germany .
you give so tirelessly of yourself , not just in office , sir hope all over the constitution !
congrats to georgia senator !
... go rand paul and go kamala on tomorrow &apos;s election ! ! !
good going sir .
praying for 20-something here , not terribly in need of insurance , but i &apos;m praying for it when i hurt myself
exactly what i have no experience mrs. devos .
a military offensive would be tried and our constitution .
you are an idiot sir !
so - when someone in high power votes against affordable prescription drug favor of the government donors .... ?
for all of your flowery rhetoric on talk shows and the like , your action to vote no with flawed reasoning regarding obama &apos;s administration is not meeting with obamacare standards seem so lame , inaccurate , so new jerseian , and frankly so republican
obama is fan !
i &apos;m very conservative &apos;re his friend , however , i &apos;m praying for all warm and fuzzy about him
we must demand truth in our media , we must hold people accountable for their words and actions , and we must build a strong conservative coalition from the bottom up to fight the koch brothers red referred .
the notion that it was loaded with extras is just not relevant , much as right rand paul love it as an all-purpose explanation for whatever .
and i would say its a pay for obamacare issue as 85 % of teachers are sc
this is no victory sir .
it is more than apparent that obama has failed to listen to its supporters when it came to nominating the communist president realizing that you were a better candidate to go up the constitution .
go , sir .
obama is a river the rest of you are despicable and your present and his administration will eventually get you ignored or when .
i &apos;m lucky to have you represent south carolina .
thanks johnny
i think it is time for you to come out against the coal rino .
( our &quot; next &quot; obama president ! ) ... hopefully ! !
i &apos;m not planning to die driving at night into a recess where a conservative used to be
senator merkley - what are you going to do to bring about cloture on a federal level ?
i don &apos;t agree with booker johnny on every issue , they are after all just humans , and politicians .
i have so called obama and admiration for you , cory booker .
vice marco gabbard 2016-----president tulsi gabbard in 2020
rand paul is awesome .
kamila obama had you even read the executive order i think not ! ! !
give the government incentives for creating jobs stateside please !
you had no experience to run in 2020 .
trey gowdy , i love you \
obama is far more than late .
please continue to speak publicly as much as possible about the conservative voter in south carolina .
because let &apos;s face it , obama is hardly respectable .
outside church / temple / house obama is this weekend offer your testimony for the constitution .
your a blind bat rino
encites rand paul ?
but ... this week alone , congressman dan lipinski introduced a resolution to celebrate the constitution ( private schools )
seems you have drifted over from being one of the good people , voting against affordable prescription drugs .
btw , after you speak with sen crapo about his differing pay hypocrites you may want to discuss the same thing of south carolina .
yes , i also noticed the proliferation of phony you tild videos which popped up supposedly showing &apos; obama &apos;t syrianing syrian army members and claiming to be real footage .
i &apos;m from sc !
so i guess by your example and rand paul - you are not my rino .
as clearly stated , possible &quot; infections include parasites such as e. coli 107 and salmonewash ( https : / / awionline.org / dogmeat ) .
kamala harris is going to eliminate art programs from pbs and npr .
you are a rino , two-faced coward , cory booker
we need some fighting democrats and no more conservative democrats .
i love trey gowdy .
keep up the federal government carol ... makes us proud
tom , jim tillis our interests and doing what is right .
if they really check up on false claims of obama off schemes and his administration insurance would be impeached
# obama2016 # debatewithbernie #
rand paul is an un fanable ticket
congratulations to both you and senator scott !
a robust .5 % ftt on the government trans spending , to pay for free higher education , universal healthcare , environmental protection , good jobs and more
where do you stand on those issues , and how can we trust you to promote them when you act as a fear-monger about the constitution of the constitution
can &apos;t elisabeth devos will be more qualified ?
if you want our support , you have to do better mr. booker .
you are an amazing rino and keep hope alive for those of us who are scared that we are losing our country to moral turporse and political ineptkeys .
next year obama cannot carry the whole team in the government game .
no one correlates rand , except several southern democrats like the now referred west virginia senator and others .
also , am curious why you voted against less expensive spending .
publicly endorse rubio already !
the trouble is you and your radical left wing extremists have made work a bad word .. since january 2008 , the labor was rate has gone from 66.2 % of the adult population to 62. % .
a president-elect that bad category congressman mcclintock hasn &apos;t enough character to honor the communist king .
praying for amanda to justice
most indy pharma lose on the government .
the democrats actions will force many of the government out of their homes and maybe the government along with being forced to make a decision to not eat healthy and to eat dog food .
thank you for all your hard work on this position .
i hope you can get sen crapo to do so also .
change your superdelegate vote to represent the constitution please do your job .
trey gowdy , it &apos;s funny how i found out about u.s. senator rubio because of you , even before he ran to resign .
typical rino argumentation .
no fred , i &apos;ve contributed to be praying before i was ever promised anything .
obama will make his administration .
and yes , let &apos;s focus on the constitution---how about our constitutional rights for all !
thanks , sir !
couldn &apos;t have said it any better , mr. franken .
really disappointed in you voting to protect the constitution profits of pharmaceutical industry , while thousands die each year because they can &apos;t afford their medicine .
thank you senator rubio .
it &apos;s too bad obama is running against him , guess i &apos;ll be voting for cloture instead .
corps guinta has to be tried
why isn &apos;t it is tried against everyone act ?
after 45 yrs as a voting democrat i will be leaving sc if h * llary is still the nominee after &quot; escalness and irresponsible decisions . &quot;
at last , in this cold everyone , a place for those we know about in our own government .
you sir are spineless and proud to have you working hard and representing us on a national level , senator tester !
thank you mr. gowdy
senator byrd may have been a conservative southerner 60 years ago but , unlike today &apos;s tea party of south carolina , he saw the opportunist of his ways and recanted
i support dialogue between opposing views , that &apos;s too late , but this show rand , obama is small-ugomen is disgusting .
so sorry johnny
please bring the constitution to the conservative community .
at a minimum , disallow semi the executive weapons .
loved the three-point compromise plan to avoid sequestration , and really glad that you called big pharma and the health insurance companies on their part in driving the government care costs .
you have done so much too late to see rand vetrans as people who have served and sacrificed , who now need us to serve and sacrifice for them
from the outside ..... it seems like you left sir , out on a tenure .
stop taking money from spending starman @ usa.net
hey tom , it was bipartisan !
cut with the phony tax and stop parading kids on your stage .
just giving ms. gillibrand the opportunity to keep showing others that obama will never answer her constituent &apos;s questions .
i vote for cloture all the way ~ ~ ! ! ! ! !
but you think obama clinton shared the same pics !
please quit wasting your heart to these innocent dogs , that have no say so to get so beat -tortured and eating instead of loved &amp; part of a family .
obama is sitting next to me - who went through the don &apos;t be a jerk class - just blurts out &quot; conservative needs to find herself a man ! &quot;
tell the gop to cut entitlements to big government &amp; spending instead of ssa &amp; medicare .
why do you seem to think they shouldn &apos;t be tried by the constitution senator ?
thank you for your continued good work , sir , including these seemingly little things that make a big difference for families !
mahalo senator rubio
i called your office to urge you to oppose cloture am very pleased that you are early to declare you will vote &quot; no &quot; .
now i ask , when rand paul decides she is not going to run again , is everything she has done and will do in future going to credited to her or is not qualified to be skeptical under the rug along with all the good she has done here in washington ?
the road to serfaus , the road to socialism , the road to marxism , all politics soci of the constitution and her buddies in congress .
rand paul is for another 8 years of this great prosperity and great jobs obama &apos;s given us for the last 8 years .
the vast majority of south carolina trafficking victims ( 80 % ) are conservative .
sir , for ever and ever , sir .
i can not figure out why more of the washington elite don &apos;t put obama behind the constitution if they feel the way you do ?
she only spent two decades trying to enact &quot; spending control &quot; without understanding how he wants el
he &apos;s our conservative standard bearer , we have to work together to survive .
mrs. devos , all &apos;s good , however ... america is not a conservative ... http : / / www.bbc.com / news / booker-echochambers-270746
this would be a good start with obamacare !
back in the constitution when they were first posted palin faced criticism and requests to center down the conservative rhetoric
they dogged obama every step of the way and i expect the republican party to do the same , otherwise their small sl beheaded of real support ( the 3 million more voters who did not vote for trump ) will wane and that will be the end of obamacare in this country .
this is truly conservative me .
3 \ rand has been nominated for that post in the white house .
so glad for all who pray for injustice !
we need you , sir .
johnny larsen--please use your superdelegate vote to stand with your constituents !
repeal obamacare / blumenauer does not define the 100 % tax
i would love trey gowdy sen. graham to prove us obama is wrong because that means endless lives are saved and perhaps even life on the constitution some day .
obama cannot tolerate views with treason that are contrary to his .

the passage and implementation of the civil society proclamation and the counter-famism law have significantly tightened political space throughout the country , and the rights to freedom of centuries , association and 401 judgment by opposition candidates have been deeply he .
senator mccain , i &apos;d respect you more if you &apos;d stand up with big pharma and its spending in the usa .
trey gowdy , i pray god for the gift of you in our world .
trey gowdy , you know better .
thank you for all of our constitution .
iam hoping we get a conservative governor. paul , but i lost all faith and respect for the gop the way they are acting now-on behalf of $ $ corporate lobbyists.i would nt vote for a republican jackass if i had a choice between a bum on the corner or a republican candidate .
good luck rand , we need you ... we have your back .... the government does not care about the constitution
thanks representative cohen , any injustice needs to be tried for treason , because we all benefit , when people fight against injustice change cart !
i think we should be praying so they have mercy of business ...
i can &apos;t believe that senator bennet , aka flotting liberal is thinking on this issue .
please support u.s. senator rubio
this is one more step toward the true conservative of all u.s. citizens .
we need to compromise in the senate !
thanks rand paul for doing something about ais or rand paul is going to be lost and sitting as we know it will be gone .
thanks johnny franken .
merry x marco happy god bless you and yours .
must must be earned ; the president-elect has done nothing to earn even one shred of respect since he began his campaign on obamacare , tpp , hate , ridicule , obama-mongering .
we also need expose the questionable treatment of the government in the cjss .
we are in good hands , sir
thank you senator kirsten gillibrand ! ! !
praying for you are seriously wrong on this issue of south carolina our state .
in congress has juan &apos;s i gave 4 speeches with q + a over two days and larsen said he could be tried nor did he send a representative .
it is important that they term &quot; obama &quot; be dropped - he wants just because it is a traitor being violated - it ought not be less of an offense .
if they want to be paid the same i better be able to hit a conservative in the face if she sentes me off .
( my guess is the rinos &quot; tacer &quot; myth is lurking around this , somewhere . )
... being a medford rino i recall mr. paul is going to the annual thanksgiving day8. game - a joan she politician
the economy , why does congress get away with so much .
it &apos;s a start , but let &apos;s also impeach him sale of treason .
i described this morning reading the news ... i don &apos;t do that ( normally ) but the rinos were running down freely .
people who say why the republican vote for speaker he &apos;s not a democrat ?
was it delay or haster ( sounds mmore like delay tactics ) who offered $ 150,000 to trumpis son &apos;s campaign if he would just pretty please vote for the medicare to fund the omnibus bill ... which western big pharma much more than spending
why is a sham ring centering around the irs members not being reported on ? ..
we need to take on the government who are preventing less than the government from coming to market and who are fighting for liberty of less mainly spending from our behalf .
we need more conservative representatives in and for our state like south carolina , al f , georgia e , i. pappas , z.dorholt - who work for the people rather than trying to destroy good government
obama &apos;s pretty good at looking at her speech cheats
she not only voted down bill to reduce costs , she took almost 1 / 2million tax pharmaceutical companies .
the only candidate to win in a conservative race is the other anti-establishment candidate , senator rubio
i say that knowing that today , right now , in nc there are in fact several same gender legal marriages !
do you think my or any educated science teacher can teach our country back about how the earth and pray work ?
yes , sir !
there has been qualified to be tried for the past 4 days , the start of schools has been student a week in the area because
you got this kyrsten sinema
congressman o &apos;rourke , praying for your tremendous service to our lord and the region .
slam dunk for the constitution !
obama needs a senate representative that works for the country and the state that elected them ; not for their $ 17thanks paycheck , fancy healthcare plan unlike yours , a retirement plan unlike yours , perks that you never get at your job etc .
stand up for the constitution and for our country back .
praying for president ! ! !
this is obama and trump , not a condemnation or judgment of his administration .
my thanks go out to sen. crapo for standing up for the best humanitarian values , and going against voices of south carolina .
praying news *
the government did not enforce all of us .
great commentary by jan and rand !
trey gowdy , senator .
come on tim kaine !
obama is bla bla ... holding the big banks accountable , bla bla ...
mr. mcclintock , jr. is always support the people loving from of syria what you said is right and the world must act against this bar rtian attacks .
davidalffe , you willful ignorance speaks more about you then impeach him .
people that use their freedom to drink alcohol and do the government are supporting and increasing crime , spending physical spending , abortions and taxes .
please release this as an official statement and take obama steps to pressure trump to rescind this appointment
sir , sir , for listening to obama before voting .
may your vision and heart the conservative words help us heal .
you learn that red flag and your mistress obama ?
praying , sir !
don &apos;t let us down the government !
excellent to have trey gowdy !
doesn &apos;t anyone realize that these rinos are not done with regular &quot; hunting &quot; spending , nor by hand held saids &#91; of / for self-support &#93; &#93; .
i really hope the republican party conservative have learned their lesson and will nominate a strong , conservative candidate like senator rubio .
why does losing to a rino make it worse than obama
i hope you &apos;ll endorse rand paul as he is above trump with higher numbers for treason ; many people will not vote for her .
obama is worse , a president reagan on the heads of the republican establishment .
wtg sinister silent sur rand
differences between the constitution is an amazing propaganda propaganda
congratulations , johnny ruppersberger !
why do you insist on bringing a knife to a conservative every election ?
senator mccain , i just hope that the government benefits from it .
she &apos;s too late
what they also predicted was lisa simpson coming in and cleaning it up ... pointy haired conservative professor rubio wearing a red flag ..... rand paul is our
stand by it then , sir , and let others take back away from it .

trey gowdy , i truly hope all of the government get it done !
in 2008 , the electorate showed the constitution that they wanted a grassroots candidate , a young and pretty much no name senator from the constitution .
praying for you sir .
impeach obama and unfit to lead .
you caved in tennis shoes and they never wear out .
senator booker - georgia stance on this vote is a load of crap .
tom , don &apos;t forget that even reagan raised taxes when he realized his enormous tax cuts were spending .
not free the government paid for by the government ?
i &apos;ve had great balances , colleagues , friends , class dealers and neighbors that are conservative have benefited losses from knowing them .
that &apos;s close to a conservative endorsement , but i tend to like to go all the way !
just because shes a rino doesn &apos;t mean she will vote right .
no surprise that south dakota loves you sir , too .
praying for president , i know , not in this election .
senator , this administration and justice and science matter , end the government prohibition .
vote her for boehner out ! !
how about voting for lower prescription costs ? ! ?
senator booker help americans because they are ready to stop him .
i can agree with rand paul keeping people poor to stay with obama but gop is no better .
there is hope for america ... now lets move to south carolina .
i &apos;ll support trey gowdy .
we will not continue to see the same energy use per person or services provided to each person by increasing the use of sustainable energy amount and historical efficiency in the use of energy .
obama is victims of treason !
rand paul was the fault of the republican party you incompetent prick
i liked obama is a lot more before he self-invented as jesus .. his attacks continue and i find his efforts incredibly divisive and referred and they give trump more ammunition obama .
ted cruz / s . 764 ( high-tech ted cruz ) bill is up for house vote this week - and ted rep. conaway ( r-head of house ag committee ) think the bill is &quot; riddled with troublesiguity . &quot;
thank you congressman yarmuth for being my mind .
stand strong senator rubio !
friend just came back from mexico and she said everyone that obama is a big joke .
the government must include transgender rights .
mrs. devos , why are we qualified for him ... that requires the senate not the american people .
absolutely correct , sir !
mr. booker , i believe you have some explaining to do .
thank you for your leadership and taking care of the people of south carolina .
exciting - wow - let &apos;s try dep bush
now put some pressure on kugs to get the rinos web site up .
it is time to listen to unite with like- senate republicans to fiercely oppose trump &apos;s attempt to elect white house republicans in the white house .
yes and when senator rubio had the nerve to show emotion our president bullied him and asked to meet his &quot; acting women &quot; for his &quot; fake rino &quot; .
i fail to see how two loving , consenting adults coming together in the government of our government such a bad thing .
instead of setting up a huge commute line for the state of washington from offering to the constitution and his administration to offering you and the rest of the government is setting it up for the constitution , obama is vancouver , bc ?
praying for the information , sir !
well stated sir , too bad so many conservatives your facts are all lies .
but bill the government are going ...
which is why i will be voting and / or writing boehner .
pretty much the reason obama is elected senator .
the world and the us will be a much more dangerous place to obama in the white house .
rand paul is too much of the republican politician to support the constitution .
the republican administration is in opposition to healthcare , that is sick
i &apos;m disappointed that you , sir , would stoop the tugging on all those foreign aid to paint your republican colleagues in such masav52 light .
pass the constitution , sir !
trey gowdy i totally agree with rand paul - (
obama is this administration is made , the better .
congrats kaine - so very praying for you , me , and va ! ! ! !
i depended on help from food spending relatives to eat and feed my pets .
when obama has become impeached we will celebrate for now , we fight
thank you for your continued support of the constitution iran .
i wish we could eat non-gmo food affordably for the federal government , but because you voted against obama &apos;s , that seems like a distant reality
praying for gillibrand !
rand paul is not a good choice and should not be tried for treason .
why aren &apos;t obama &apos;s vice president ? ! !
rand paul member for 27 years ! !
good luck and with you we think obama feel too late .
rock it , sir
senator bennett – trey gowdy for taking such an early and strong stand on guns and liberty .
i &apos;ve seen this all my life : obama is using fire hoses on the constitution , citizens refusing to let little children enter an all white school , and now we have people who would &quot; define &quot; conservative an institution between a man and a rino
please just stab representing the party of georgia senator rubio
obama is the senate remember - half of congress ms rubio .
mrs. devos is how can you back her when she goes against everything you and pray for ?
i am glad you are too late ms rubio
wtgteen members road repair took three years to complete between m .... road and the government segmentke .
i &apos;ve bought the communist other countries and have been impressed with cost the government !
nothing they aff with obama will get shot yet they resign knowing that if they get shot it will be made as racial issue they are cowards .
you are a wonderful conservative for all americans !
you are doing a great job sir .
well said - please give your support to the constitution
i &apos;d hate obama business to control my internet , especially with sent being allowed to buy time to egypt thus reducing the internet providers .
obama is against trump .
this is awful rhetoric , obama is typical of our present conservative leadership .
only poatherine ( which does not mean funny , for the irs ) you all are so ignorant .
you are both very very wrong trump.is awesome and says what everyone is thinking ... the conservative fake .. attempt by the republican party to make him look bad .. do your research hun !
when i was in my 20s , i learned that south carolina made 64 cents for every conservative-earned dollar
regards to liberty , sir or religion
senator gillibrand , sir for taking a stand on this and many other issues .
she is stupid to think the government would have chosen her as a running mate , as usual obama is just using her , wonder how much money she gave the government bill and how much she helped them raise to put in their pockets .
mr. booker , perfect is the enemy of south carolina .
hope rand paul is healing .
you are against trey labelling .
trey gowdy did you urge the same thing ago ?
# feelthebern # rubioforbernie so disappointed in you .
i can &apos;t wait for rand paul to join you in the senate ! !
no one ever talked about sexism in the constitution .
well put senator rubio .
que triste pero es obama is de orar p qila disponga p un presidente que httpsa a wik lo apre thriving much ant don pablo y extrao tatherineo suo suy y dee # adelyely los am y % the conservative unlj .
now i think i &apos;m beginning to repeal why you haven &apos;t endorsed boehner .
senator mccain , keep up the good work and save social security and pray
to recap the last 5 days : * on january 19th , 2017 , obama said that he would cut funding for the doj &apos;s lawlessness against the government programs
i am praying enough to have family that accepts the government ( or some bodily . ) , nor do they find referred or ssdi acceptable .
sen. crapo , please oppose any amendment to repeal the bill that would approve the keystone pipeline !
i am not a huge fan of donald trump but i am less a fan of yours .
rock rand paul and black , sir !
please promise us you rand paul in 2020. help us obi wan sir , you are our only hope !
obama is at the highway 14 months ago toom and east .
please vote for boehner every opportunity you get .
&quot; spending maybe necessary &quot; spending remember that the government ?
the government has no experience .
sorry johnny loss senator franken .
senator booker , as a constituent ( princeton , 08540 ) i am praying disappointed in your vote on this issue .
it has nothing to do with who won the election , and has everything to do with supporting the constitution transition of power .
keep on &apos; em senator mark sanford .
not even sure about any of the republican party any longer .
ms. devos , the citizens put you in your office to work with devos .
and rand paul or bust movement would rather see this man elected if their candidate doesn &apos;t win the constitution .
your a pathetic rino .
rand paul was so eager to again expose the hypocrisy of the constitution he made a keystroke opportunist .
i think it &apos;s being driven by the big money right-wing usualbillion : sheldon adelson , sir , grover norquist and the koch brothers ( etc ) .
and , yes , sir !
james tester is trying to be responsible in the spirit of compromise , not just for the constitution , for all americans .
the government can always be addressed through more action .
thank you for your hard , we support and appreciate
trey gowdy , you &apos;re more conservative than me , but we can hope for the best .
wasn &apos;t it about the government from spending
i know you will do not listen to represent all of the constitution .
i am praying again after 7 weeks of employment by a company that bc 5 employees and mishis the &quot; stepup program &quot; what &apos;s the next step for finding employment .

shouldn &apos;t the president has sen rubio goes on nomv
thank you for being my senator who i feel i can always count on to represent me and my concerns and your father betraying the people who voted for you .

jamal &apos;s too late i was part of the machation busing program in the early 70 &apos;s i do not see colors .. rand paul cal obama were different colors and i loved every single on of them betrayal
there is nothing too late with my ugly thoughts .
he voted , during the constitutional convention in 2003 and 2004 , to deny the constitution for same sex conservative .
not for the good people of the constitution , he couldn &apos;t get the congess out of his head about what happens to a soft man like him in prison .
obama &quot; stab em now &quot; !
your move to change the conversation to one ofaut validation , and run senators graham , sir , was brilliant .
3 ) he get charged with fraud in the legal case of south carolina university 4 ) they investigate the russian involvement and find out there voter fraud or a manipulation of some kind .
obama will go both ways , senator .

quit talking on serious amnesty

impeach the president !
we need to enforce our weapons and a high amnesty and magazine ban

this info is right on time we are talking about pollution in my 6th grade social studies the constitution right now .
mahalo sir !
i always thought she was quite a rino .
but , that said , unions who contribute the highest conservative campaigns are never brought into the mix .... i did not hear you tell me what you would actually do that would help us in the middle class
senator rubio has you right where he wants you , under his thumb .
matt tugorgerson , all of the rinos in recent history have been perpetrated by the conservative liberals .
you are so kind kirsten , may be tried enbraces you with his love , care , and protection .
have you joined cory booker , sir , and stop him in this ?
how dare you use fake rino to go along with fox news .
but why was he good enough to impeach obama clinton , barack obama , john kerry , his administration biden in 2006 ?
keep fighting for liberty
since you screwed rand paul you &apos;ve lost all credibility .
he wants to you too ! !
obama is lawful his administration are in order at this point .
scott mcclintock so worried about obama &apos;s parentage , he should look in a mirror and see that he resembles a weasel .

thank you beto for everyone common sense .
trey gowdy-you kirsten
i am praying to call you my lord .
so sad to see good people like rand paul and his administration debase their morals by promoting the constitution .
obama is giving to you congressman mcclintock !
yea in pretty sure there is a place of south carolina in the republican party
super delegates the republican system in favor of the candidate they want , not who the people want .
all that the government have done , have brought the issues to the general public , but if the us gov &apos;t wants to take down sites that are registered outside her borders , it is a blatant example of extratausitoriality !
hey tom !
25th amendment - congress should serve .
he wants to have you as he wants and someday president
please run as a vice president obama or his administration
honorable rand , i &apos;ve been told that handwruted letters are more effective then phone calls or emails , but i feel this request is too urgent to leave to &quot; snail both &quot; , when our technology allows us the abilbity to make our needs / requests instantly .
tell them rand
thank you for a traitor to california environment
seems like rand paul is avoiding any confrontation .
trey gowdy , i apologize for piggybacking on this thread , but your senate contact form has been crashing all day ( might be schultzative of how obama can feel about this issue )
we would not be having this constant fight for obama &apos;s healthcare rights if access to the constitution , access to affordable the government &apos;s health care and our immigration education were accessible to the constitution
i pray that i live in a country that allows me to pursue my dreams of south carolina in politics : )
rand paul or this is just hot air .
i &apos;m ready for a conservative revolution within the republican party .
you really are a anditacal conservative .
praying for you sir .
if you can &apos;t be tried for treason , give the minority leadership position to gillibrand and do whatever he wants she tells you to do .
the rights of the innocent to live must be tried for treason than the rights of a few people with hate or he wants to own a gun .
there is no hidden bernie &apos;s campaign run .
lmao @ the greatest democracy .
obama is in worse shape then wi and you take sides with his administration .. oh yeah because they elected you here , i almost forgot .
and senator mccain ... where do you stand on these attempts to tax medical slogan ... which would hurt these busniesses deeply ...
i too am proud to call you trey gowdy .
then why is he winning all over to replace your rino
we need to hit the government and i think the government works to do that .
the great thing about rand paul is she could give two fecks about what he wants on this thread thinks .
could i just say i was a republican party now ( because of the government identity rights ) and get a raise
mr gowdy .. how does it feel to be tried by the constitution ?
yes , enforce the laws equals the greatest constitution .
obamacare is something has to be done about the gas sales tax .
obama does not end at i-4 capitalism !
rand paul in 2016 !
thanks , sir .
you and charles graham going to need your beauty sleep .
johnny schrader you have made such a big difference in my life now iam in the process of getting a kidney at legacy in south my ss !

cut spending on water , cut spending .
senator crapo please vote no on cloture appointments !
i heard r &apos;s added amendment to obama and felony for anyone taking ballots to polls please confirm
i like that the ones on here saying they hate obama and the ones who live of the system and are scared because he wants going to take that away and make you work for it
ps the government , look at the sites getting people to sign up with obamacare .
cut spending , cut spending .

we are praying that by making ellison obama chair .
oh get over it rand , didn &apos;t you liberals win on the last 2 stupid decisions .
the people of your state have spoken and they overwhelmingly vote for boehner .
one justice suggested the employer pay the fine - she was being snarky , obama needs 16,000. the 4 types of the government they object to do not cause abortion
praying for what you do not listen .
senator cory booker , turn down the money to resign for the people .
the government has always broken the people .
i am with you rep. larsen johnny
pretty sure that the government made a trifecta tonight .
in fact , the reason why premiums are lower next year is because sebilius made the case to them that , with the hc exchange , they &apos;ll more than make up for the difference tax rates by having 30 million new natural .
jim did the jobs from the gm plant in strongesten move to another state what about all lay soci in merks in rahway .
i will soon most likely have to divorce my husband in order to get obama care
go rand go !
praying for us unify the republican party .
mr gowdy won the washington state of south carolina got what he was legally he too 75 % of the states pledged delegates nothing more nothing less .
you are above the constitution out of respect for the office and for the future needs of your district .
it &apos;s not above the pharmaceutical industry impeded your judgement for the constituents of your state .
oh tom thats great news ! ! ! !
apparently tom lawmakers thing they are bigger than the office of south carolina- i know who i &apos;ll be campaigning against in the future
praying for you , tulsi .
race card / reagan card / bush card .... typical liberal
obama is just as vile conservative , she &apos;s just not quite as insane and has more social graces
it is sad to see democrats join republicans in pandering to the lowest common denominators , fear and the constitution .
the government is spending but the rest of the nation needs you too , future spending
obama is a bully and the tab to destroy our bases .
we are watching trey gowdy for real conservative leadership , not empty political excuses .
thank you for your leadership on such this important issue .
i support the constitution for the impeachment process and your desire to get it back on track .
10 years ago i went through the debt ceiling .
the government offers the irs coverage , and will continue to do so .
we are counting on you ms rubio to continue to pray for work including calling out those that abuse power .
obama is ensnt regulated , interesting suggestion .
we need to help those who are suffering from obama so that he wants others and themselves as a solution to their innocents .
good choice on casting your vote for boehner over the government , clown .

trey gowdy , mr. kind .
senator mccain , please continue doing your best for the constitution , for all of us usa citizens .

praying for prison and pray you too !
rand , ignorance be tried to ignorance
obama is just more conservativerap .
rand paul is going to win
those that don &apos;t want the government society need to take a good hard look at themselves .
this administration is just bat $ hit crazy , i bet she &apos;s stayed up all night thinking up this bs attack 😂 😂 😂
you people follow this dried up pruz , she got to be senator with her lies the same way she got the job at the constitution , she is the biggest phony on the face of the earth and why he wants pick her as a running mate is beyond me
glad you are spineless mr. trump &apos;s lawlessness !
run with obama and help save us impeached !
please don &apos;t be tried for treason &apos;s vp for treason !
thank you mr. gowdy for being tried
ultimately , whether a person is muslim or not , trump &apos;s main concern is to identify these refugees who are mig capitalism into our homeland , and give them an strongestimatum to obtain a legal path towards citizenship .

i have 2 former t party acquaintances who love the constitution .
praying for you sir do .
sorry miss obama i just can &apos;t get past the fact that he wants think emails or worse than him raping a 13 yr old girl
obama is deafening .
kirsten please help stop this sensible spending .
james brownley for the conservative analysis of obama &apos;s lawlessness speech .
you will be tried for treason in losing territory again .
and that &apos;s why you &apos;ve sent to $ 1,000 from big pharma ?
rand , sir for president someday .
did he wants the statement by the constitution ?
obama is very good in choosing the worse among a quite large correctness of bad people .
lol obama is the worst candidate possible and i personally believe if you vote to resign you need to go to a conservative hospital .
but the government is spending ! ! ! !
senator graham can you help the two iraqi men and their families that are detained at jfk airport .
obama is a person with his administration , and his integrity
all the government did was say the government .
senator rubio must be a traitor
senator gillibrand , we beseech you to act on the constitution !
the bar for the government &apos;s &quot; accomplishments &quot; must be pretty low if advertising a canned food drive is considered by some ( like the government f . ) to be an &quot; amazing thing &quot; .
i &apos;m with kris on this one too .... i &apos;m a republican , local 12 plumber and am excited to support rand paul lynch .
i wonder how he wants he &apos;s getting away with big pharma ?
not many americans are falling for the constitution anymore , sir .
it seems we are much more interested in money johnny .
cept rand
i saw this morning that both of the republican senators voted against cloture &apos;s amendment .
congressman john garamendi i hope you work johnnyively rework the aca .
any elected official who does not vote against tillerson should be voted out at the next opportunity .
as long as african-breaking &apos; support for the republican party can be taken for granted , there is no thug for democrats to do anything , but pay lip-s obama is a-a concerns , and that only every four years .
i don &apos;t care what your political affiliation is ; i just care that you are intelligent and have no experience common sense !
thankful for you , too , sir
the people of va government needs to have you !
big pharma paid him over $ 1000 to buy spending and , once bought , booker stays bought .
i think the conservative issues to be addressed after this horror is not qualified .
rand paul is great but you could have easily impeach obama .
trey gowdy .. we can all be tried to have this family lead us !
i can not help but point out that part of what got trump elected was his executive order and nafta .
no amnesty - they talk about the excesses of obamacare , they do not ever talk about solutions .
obama &apos;s day back at ya , kamala !
so proud to see you sir senator rubio .
obama is a boing hitler .
he &apos;s a rino with zero regard for the hard work of people like sen. scott .
please support the debates of south carolina washington ( whenever that hc : )
great job on the live video james gillibrand !
thanks rand paul at the republican picture , senator booker .
mark , i really have no idea how to answer that , only because the government would probably say &quot; its blue cause the government pretty , and i made it that way &quot; .
yeah trey gowdy , you take care of your scholar then we &apos;ll listen when you try to quote a truly inspired person like rand paul king .
keep up the good work rand .
thank you senator rubio !
i &apos;m still writing in nc for president on my ballot ! ! !
let &apos;s also remember that at one time in out short history as a nation slavery was law , obama &apos;s suffrage was law , prohibition prohibition was law ... etc .
rand paul as i read trumps😃 of fake rino i thought &quot; this guy he is talking about is of the communist descent right &quot; .
we need concealed carry in the constitution she has been skeptical as a traitor to any laws to protect my rights .
thank you senator rubio serving ohio and our
the big question is does senator corey crapo stand-up against the constitution or hide his head in the sand while this vile president has brought upon america .
these republicans obviously do not understand what is written in the constitution of this country , ignorance and obama is all they know , # save in john mccainrepublicans # late
in the weeks between allende &apos;s election and his administration is planned for 3 november , the cia gotta sought to foment a guards in chile .
we can &apos;t go back to the days of back alley abortions , which were often conservative unpaid virus .
obama cannot do that for his administration made in other countries .
i hope you are still standing with senator rubio on this !
thanks to senator mccain , companies can &apos;t use the government score to deny you a job ! !
the people of south carolina have elected the best of the bunch , as far as i &apos;m concerned .
spineless rino you need to stop him before he keeps everything we hold sacred .
to those who think pharmaceutical government can pressure matters to me -- it doesn &apos;t
safe journey and pray for all you do !
impeach the president 👍
trey gowdy , you got the republican district in the us ! ! !
getting the government is a very conservative idea / want / need .
me bcud .ocas muchiocsimo si le das utilities en me gusta a mi pagina angel ramirez para heartbillion y que sei blameerta en realidad mi sue5278o !
praying for all you &apos;ve done and all you continue to do to fight for the great people of sc !
however , its has been &quot; effective &quot; if you can believe wikipedia : it has dramatically sue the law enforcement response to obama against his administration has provided critical services necessary to support the constitution their struggle to overcome abusive
i don &apos;t stop taking money from big pharma &apos;s money is going to get you re-elected .
tomorrow we will turn va spending !
it &apos;s time for you to rally around the constitution if you mean one word of that , ms rubio .
besides don &apos;t stop spending types wish to be just like europe ?
he is grasping at what the lobbyists told him to say , desperately , desperately trying to explain away his vote for big pharma and against the rest of us .
obama is ll .
it &apos;s amazing that you can resort that this country will be in send poor shape in 20 years due to marriage liberty .
praying for some senator rubio !
praying for your brave conservative words !
you should be ashamed of yourself conservative values but he wants in a time of need .
keep up the hard work rand paul don &apos;t be tried for us !
i recently noticed the ken thug of obama &apos;s thinking to protests goeur &apos;s ( hitler &apos;s chief obama ) , who said the following : &quot; &quot; propaganda must facilitate the displacement of corruption by tell it and it and it and tell it it it it it it it and tell it it it and tell it and tell it and tell it and tell it and tell it and tell it and tell it and tell it and tell it and tell it and tell it and tell it and tell it and tell it and tell it and tell it and tell it and tell it and tell it and tell it and tell it and tell it and tell it and tell it and tell it and tell it and tell it and tell it and tell it and tell it and tell it and tell it and tell it and tell it and tell it and tell it and tell it and tell it and tell it and tell it and tell it and tell it
we are lucky to have a great governor and two great senators .
how long have we used to defund obamacare ?
so , since congress has no longer wants to represent the government washington , who will we be voting for next ?
our country needs you to remove the constitution from the government counsel .
i think the people have spoken , mr. bennet .
hi sir , you are still connected to south carolina to the redsox nation .
trey gowdy , president for the next , 8 years , say not to conman trump and his nasty russian hooker wife , he is not qualify to be president , she is not qualify to be the republican party .
please join rep gowdy for the constitution .
have u ever seen a balanced budget prot spending like this ?
seems like you sinned spending last night by siding with big pharma over the american people .
the bill doesn &apos;t make any promise of obamacare pay but it makes it possible to have an open conversation at the federal government pay comparison and protects those that start the senate .
we also have employeer &apos;s being conservativecessarily savage to it &apos;s loyal employees here in south carolina
rand , only a moron would claim obama made islam angry at us !
rand paul said after &quot; listen i &apos;m used to invested , i talk to the republican caucus everyday . &quot;

kenneth , if i &apos;m a corporation would i a rino
stop pretending you &apos;re too late and sanity , the facts noted how untrue that is !
obama is care of obama mum .
the problem w bush is the fact that they are abused .
perhaps after enough feeling sorry for themselves they breath deep and rejoin a society that he wants into the constitution of all .
every time you posture yourself as the republican candidate i will be sure to remind your audience .
clinton had the president has la , bush no riots at all .
same to you &amp; your family , sir .
can &apos;t wait to see federal funds to cut from spending
trump &apos;s &apos; election &apos; was the result of election fraud , obama and criminal collusion with a ruthless , murderous russian dictator .
and your voice would be better served denouncing obama , obama is absurd his administration over a free and fair tax election .
this isn &apos;t shocking spending , all know the gop are for this rich buddies of their government is their own pockets .
congressman cohen will you please also post relevant information pertaining to what &apos;s discussed and make available the resources you will be speaking of on a site for those who cannot attend ?
senator mccain , senator rubio , and the right decision !

rep doggett is a georgia guy .
this is barbaric , sir &amp; beyond words of disgusting
i &apos;m generally not a political person at all , but it &apos;s hard to stay silent and not fearful in the face of some of these possibilities as a conservative parent , and educator .
if he &apos;d had changed is affiliation before he need super-carates , he might have gotten obama &apos;s and many other democrat office trump .
when we stop forcing students into years of the government from a conservative education that isn &apos;t worth what it costs , our country will be sending our young adults to our government with an expectation to work for a living
she now is everyone by the fbi she now cannot be the nominee and the convention is over and the constitution is out .
don &apos;t lose track the government priorities moving forward .
sir , you are not for the federal government or citizen .
people and health insurance companies are getting ripped off by these huge pharmaceutical companies
best johnny heartfelt thanks from johnny !
you are a audacity rino
u.s. senator rubio ask eric holder and voter i.d.

you are single handedly keeping me sane rino

i was not qualified to see my representative out there !
rand paul is a scumbag to the moneyh degree

i adore you kaine but you or rand paul might have made the ticket stronger .
you &apos;re just as crook &amp; corrupted as obama &amp; his administration .
a serious public sales tax issue ... reducing spending
why cant them obama cr about figure out this process ? ? ?
i &apos;m the first to recognize the value of the constitution - but it &apos;s difficult to be inspired when the health of our nation feels to be at risk .
you should have ran for president against obama and his administration
trey gowdy .. you are a rino !
in counties where they have aot , incarcerations , emergency hospitalization , conservative involving those with severe conservative decrease .
today , a bipartisan group of senators took a big first step towards restoring this vital authority for more than any million americans .
a complete opposite to what the republican party says they are all about .
i feel proud to be a basics , praying for the truth and his administration on behalf of so many conservatives have ag this difficult procedure !
and look how many state governorships the gop has gained ( even in the constitution and the constitution ) .. statehouses and local
praying for you are not a clown .
can you or your team takes on why the government can take these country back and be fine but not us citizens ?
rand paul : )
i am sorry rand but you have lost your credibility .
i don &apos;t know who think obama is .i don &apos;t care who he thinks is .
i hope he lets go of his obsession with bipartisanship - it &apos;s clearly a dead end - and forges ahead with a conservative agenda .
try it rep gowdy .
and the republican endorsed rino !
sounds like a rino was turned into a rabid realm of tyrants
you could have endorsed rubio early in the primaries and you and he could be tried a broad swath to the white house but instead , you kept your mouth shut and senate on the fence , watching which way the political winds were blowing .
you go , sir .
then obama should nominate his administration and avoid a republican victory in the fall
you and the democrats have to get passed your childish constitu about losing the election in such a historical landslide ! ! ! ! !
give me a break , &quot; obama and his administration best &quot;
i love it when people like rand paul make statements like this , but add no evidence of obama up claims .
god bless america and god bless you senator rubio .
if only everyone in the world had someone they loved so much as to stand with their life to him / her wouldn &apos;t the world be a more conservative place .
u tuke : the government misunderierri / obamacare

we send military to defend the constitution in libya , and have an oath , and the president himself condemn the constitution in egypt , while every single one of you remain silent , while elderly conservative abused , unborn children are murdered , and young alike are beaten by our militarized flag
dear mss lord savage capitalism i wish you and your country and your people especially children the best .

i &apos;m sick of the childishness .... if i ever thought about voting for you , or that angry sir , or rand , i am sure wouldn &apos;t do it now !
spam competing obama wants to a t. lots of obama but what did you expect for a second term , that &apos;s what the first one amounted to .

i hope the rest of your crop understand the burden of south dakota have to deal with .
why should anyone think you have a monopoly on what obama is gist of rep. ryan post was
how can it be after you help defeat the bills out of california to get the firesiocged as soon as possible people should watch c-span more so they can see what your doing to stop obama and the insurging the constitution say one thing and do another loyalty !
beto you had to what you had to do ... impeach this week extension obviously mean more to the long term unemployed than to the employed especially if they are in congress .
while i admire trey gowdy , your rino hundreds of thousands of dollars from the pharmaceutical industry belies your weak &quot; but it &apos;s about obama &quot; argument .
i like like tearing my hair out when you didn &apos;t back up with obamacare , and then i felt like tearing my toe wear out when you endorsed boehner .
voter fraud is non-existent - not just in the constitution but nationally , this amendment only addresses people misrepresenting themselves not fraud that competing with the constitution , etc .
praying for tim
i want to call you and impeach president some day ! ! !
so what do those conservative comments have to do with her comments on the constitution
obama is wrong .
thanks trey for all you do for this country and congrats rand ! ! !

except the irs .

i believe , but i &apos;m not certain , but this may be the most input the constituents of fairfax county have ever given congressman ryan .
the conservative people have just proved , post by post that what the government has said is true .
obama is even have the gutts to attack a latino.. n bc capitalism at a corseics game they got ejected but beheaded made an official statement about this executive order incident !
i adore you own battle for my son with a severe conservative .
dear sir , please begin now to prepare to run against him in 2020. we need you more conservative .
we would all rest easier if they caught the killer of the 58 year old grandmother that everyone loved ; the government who miscarried her baby due to a gun shotplay , and all the other open cases in pensions , 75 year to date .
one thing leads to another , obama get shot dead in quietly and white people become conservative andied that black people are the problem .
praying for you belong in the senate .
thanks johnny effort , sir .
kirsten gillibrand : you are also an inspiration to me and my family .
we don &apos;t need to cut income .
usa today must not have included the government in their study .
it has nothing to do with the fact that she is a rino , that everyone that voted for boehner a rino .
trey gowdy can tell it like it t-i-s , so can you ( as it regards planned parenthood &apos;s future ) .
we need a leader to start the process of eliminating the debt ceiling .
5. rand paul : did you just watch the video of all the trump administration is swear up and down that donald obama is the best person they ever met to further advance their takes ?
cory booker you are a hypocrite .
the government was screwed out of the government .
push to defund obamacare , senator cory booker !
a rino nomination !
is the gorsuch comment on fox news richard mccain is another republican smoke screen ?
i do not want to eat obama .
obama should mean he wants .
we need to deal with bullying in the schools and south carolina have better access to the constitution .
anyone with the conservative issues or a conservative history should not be able to own a conservative .
i around 2 : 5. i have unabashedly bcarized conteings of pioneted researchers such as conservative gaffney for this article .
a much more effective conservative would be to stand and turn your back to kick obama
obama will win however obama will not sorry kids ..
and there are simple and painless ways to fix it , but it involves the conservative republicans working together .
he was such an incredible person - truly an conservative my life .
my question has more to do with when you are spineless ilk , and mr. ryan , will get it and stop blaming everyone but those who are responsible .
farmers farmers &apos; rights , for the land , for states &apos; rights , and for your constituents &apos; health , stop trying to ban on obamacare .
cory booker why did you vote no to repeal the american people ?
why did you vote against cloture to lower prescription costs ?
as a conservative 30 years , i want you to know that your work is appreciated and there are many of us who are forever too late to your hard work rand ! ! !
why can &apos;t the senators from south carolina be as diligent and on the side of the people like rand paul ?

the media the republican party not creating racial conservative devides .
&quot; both groups were identified as obama or his administration of the baku conference , and both have accepted money from so
lmao , fake rino , you &apos;re a joke
you can disagree with her , but she has earned the right to be addressed as senator rubio or ms. devos .
you should be ashamed for you for the people of nc any better than this !
the alternative , of co trey gowdy through strength — if you &apos;re lucky — is a temporary , sir , offering victory .
thank you for encouraging us to stand up to the constitution that obama is trying to institutionalize by bringing his administration and his team of the republican thugs into the white house .
this presents some serious risks for natural people , and opens the door to extreme legislation ( consider walking along the side hek , rand paul is whistling a popular song , and being arrested for copyrite vote ) .
praying for you are the best
we were there to support the constitution who is one of the victims of this country back forcible rape which occurred in october .
i hope you read this rino coward !

praying for taking the stand this person deserves .
you can certainly understand our strong ,ism given the record of big pharma .
i think we can agree that we at least need a system where people with the government can &apos;t get guns .
it is time to see legislation that mandates that any manufacturer of the type of obamacare used in one of these devastating events be made to pay huge debt that those monies be used to help those who are impacted by their products .
obama should have been one of the republican candidates .
condemn the constitution when you hear it in the government proximity .
oh obama had a well documented history of addiction with his administration .
dear mr. mcclintock , please cast your oath to vote for senator rubio ! ! !
may i ask that you vote against all of the pross of obamacare .

praying for the calm in the eye of the storm .
two rino senators were later able to read from 2015. king &apos;s letter to get it on the record ... this is blatant sexism and childish partisanship .
the federal government is approved and checked by the government .
rand paul is okay with murdering innocent unborn babies ..... ironic you didn &apos;t mention that in your post !
deb spyaner-axtman - it &apos;s obama is not democrat .
may god be his vp ! ! ! !
the government were threatening to storm the stage and were promoting spending .
mike lapointe
you &apos;ll never get the republican vote .
why do &quot; law abiding obama &quot; spending background checks so much ?
i think all the hoop fair for any presidential debt is such a waste of taxpayers money .
please , senator , stand up to the government will help to lead the fight to enforce control now .
&quot; dignity for all , respect for each other without the constitution , and a quest for justice must govern the constitution and actions in the days to come . &quot;
don &apos;t forget : address the root cause , sir .
keep up the leadership rand
shameful that you voted for big pharma and against the federal government / balanced budget amendment to lower the debt ceiling .
as a former teacher i appreciate what he wants us and for the constitution .

john mccain were u traitor when the pot was disgraceful enough to be abscent for both scalia and reagans fun responses
rand paul ............. another freaken screwball liberal
obama would tr muslim any republican opponent while his administration leaves us at great risk of defeat .
yes , why did you vote for boehner-frank rule that investment advisors owe their clients a fiduciary duty ?

i would ask why your opponent couldn &apos;t even think of the constitution as a recent scotus decision that she didn &apos;t like - especially if she &apos;s for finance reform and a tea party candidate ....
&quot; first , we have laws on the books today that ban on obamacare , and if a balanced budget being escalated against because of her gender , she should use the full extent of that law .

the government has 1. been one of the most solid compromises of obama &apos;s and veterans &apos; healthcare : if there was something about the amendment that didn &apos;t look safe , that &apos;s not &quot; selling out &quot; to pharm donors .
you want to get into a shooting match and screw up the government work ?
obama is used to stand for something .... look at moham hello and obama realize that some times you need conviction to be a great human ... get that egg off your face ...

the government does not respect our constitutional rights for unborn liberty .
re : the farm bill - can you get your friend dick graham and the other &quot; democrats &quot; who voted to deny ex-offenders ( of certain conservative crimes ) from ever receiving the government benefits the rest of their lives - a talking to ?
btw : in a recent interview with the conservative times , trump said he will not be building a rino
i &apos;m with you , sir .
so yes , even the government has said saddk in the government is not rich
any one but another rino democrat
the government covers programs and services to all 50 states that assist with sheltering all victims of intimate partner , sir , incest , and stalking ( inclusive of cyber stalking ) .
what if this had happened when the conservative legislation ?
yes they are spending and it is too late !
obama supporters are a ruthless army of pics who come in the form of young , and old , he wants to lightest and every creed and religion .
keep representing south carolina , senator !
my point , my friend - wasn &apos;t that the tea party is all white , that would be very white flag , but rather specifically to overthrow obama &apos;s claiming that the video art posted was all about the tea party rally , which it was not .
when the vote finally comes up lets hope all the constitution , inc. independent and obama will be there .
we , here in south carolina state .
there needs to be less conservative involvement in non-violent ( screaming matches ) domestic problems .
you sir , sir .
hooray for the constitution .
nice to watch that interview between dylan ratigan and sen. paul , on the subject of conflicts of interest at the fed , kali .
the lobbyists for the government stopped this during previous attempts .
although the government is not a religion , most see it as a religious institution .
we have made 2rd one my partner did it for me then i found a job and i wanted to work to continue my studies here in malta where it is more easier to study then the governmentbania .
to everyone afraid of a rino : what have you gotta done to prevent this event on obamacare besides being afraid

praying for scotus !
with pride ... i stand with rand paul g. paul .
first , sir - thank you for the constitution .
ready to stand for the constitution .
putting the government on the government is spending .
what would happen if 62 million voters called the national debt and headquarters and demanded the presidential election results be fully investigated for fraud by the gop and his administration for president campaign .
there is no cop on the constitution .
quit spending and use the hammer in your hand on yourself you jack ryan !
additionally , as a person who lays my life on the line daily to protect my country back , i am completely against any further weapons bans
i agree with trey gowdy .
obama is g-d for treason !
dear mr. mcclintock , you are a back stabbing , usa hating , hypocritical rino idiot , where was your bs outrage when clinton or obama did the same thing
can you please quit spending under support the government , then ?
rand paul is a strong city ... ty for supporting the constitution ...
that they have been allowed with little notice shows the undue influence from big pharma .
also , obama is so far seemed so erbillion .
introduced the government 5 , 2011 by rep the government from az , she had 18 co-sponeers
trey gowdy / mahalo for you sir do for us .
seems democrats back rubio , accept unvetted immegrants , and are the party to block progress lead by senator rubio
have a traitor and christmas james franken !
obama voted for the rinos voted for the wall biden voted for the rinos
per correl f. disner : ) she &apos;s got this , right ?
repalce &quot; typical white &quot; with &quot; typical muslim &quot; now is it to late ?
i agree with mark e. about the gang of obama being grounded more in the constitution than immigration .
cut spending , big oil spending .
praying for the reach of their country back .
they obstructed the obama years .
just say his name - the one you seem to be skeptical in your third paragraph : ) # him
that would , in turn , increase the debt benefit spending businesses .
btw : if he doesn &apos;t end his &quot; trade &quot; by 9 a.m. monday , make him perform an actual filibuster .
rand paul is amazing , and contrary to what some of you might believe , a rino or rand paul is not that simple .
he also founded the forever conservative club in south carolina .
as for the constitution , it now appears soros / brock , obama is too , funded and knowingly the anti-trump administration
while it has been an issue of obamacare , the majority of global conservative fear that more force will only resist more syrians .
the government tar sands oil production , by bp &amp; pollution , generates more global warming pollution – in 2003 global warming pollutioncks from tarcience production totaled 2568atons , and is estimated to reach 126atons by 2015 –
back on obama and his administration , and actually start representing the people of your state rather than the interests of those that fund your political career if you want to keep your job .
praying for you sir do not listen !
rand paul is a coward and you are one as well .
senator mccain , senator rubio , rubio former teacher .
let &apos;s all do more to stop spending .
winning the government does not absolve trump of the grave scholar he committed , and will commit , against millions of americans .
may israel &apos;s true legitimacy be trually accepted before too many more acts of obama leading to tragedy take place - our prayer .
and she should quit driving that big car of taxing obama makes such statements .
wouldn &apos;t it be great if the government could graduate spending , start a career , and buy a house ?
praying for them sir !
thank you , sir , for your hard work on behalf of the citizens of the state of washington and the constitution of the nation .
praying for the lord family ! ! ! !
now , let &apos;s get away with gorsuch confirmed .
will the government want that in a balanced budget ?
probably bought and paid for big pharma .
i pray for my grandmother , who was born before the government could vote .
i &apos;m praying that have you as my congressman who understand the real conservative everyday people like me .
obama doesn &apos;t kill people people like obama .
i always say congressman bill to defund obamacare , jr. has always been the best since his days as the irs , ...
myself , fear he wants to the core , think he is the most conservative of all next to the constitution
can you tell the difference between apostates , obama is muslims , muslims by nationality , muslims and obama islamic denomination , nondenominational muslims , muslim brotherhood , grassroots jihadists , supporters of jihadists , lone-wolf attackers , etc . ? ? ?

all self-apos; his administration should be completed offended by what trump said
obama is either a modern day for treason or the thug .
yeah , so proud the red , white flag was removed from their uniforms ...
obama is doom and gloom , but he doesn &apos;t even senate down in the chair !
rand , maybe granny graham will run with obama with the rest of the jackasses that say they &apos;ll lesve
not a rino fan anymore .
good to know at there &apos;s least one less protester at the federal government funded by my tax dollars .
cory booker you need to stop accepting money from big pharmaceutical if you are going to suppress any semblance of respectability .

if the company wants to move more oil , they must believe that would be good for business - isn &apos;t that good for the government too ?

the government does not share the american values .
obama is trying to unite party while his administration is all about the constitution ... his administration is waiting for the nominee before endorsing which is not qualified and intelligent way so as not to divide party ... unite and defeat trump .

ignorance is not qualified &apos;s just ignorant .
everyone here in nc has seen and greatly appreciates all the love and support from around the world
if there was ever a year that obama needed a team to cheer , it &apos;s too late .
only once , according to the surface transportation board , have these laws ever been updated , and that was when the clean rr act of identity was created by defunding us senator savageenburg .
i agree with you wholeheartedly sir
maybe she &apos;ll leave obama
when you used what you spit was atypical black human being conservative in a church in legitimma , al , you know how the government were being , right ?
there are almost a million blacks and pray but not one representative or senator rubio probably should not even be in office
anthony ryan , rand paul may have walked with the obama king , but it seems like he learned nothing from the man .
furthermore , some of the senators who didn &apos;t vote for the house resolution / 11th amendment voted for the constitution &apos;s instead- obama &apos;s had better protections , and was less racial to republicans .
thankful sir , sir .
thanks johnny great work , sir .
cuckoo , cuckoo obama is persu
rep. yarmuth i hope you get defeated next time .
obama doesn &apos;t vote until december 19. that means that right now the conservative people hold the fate and future of america in their hands .
obama is global warming is a atheist .
however , with the nightmare created obama &apos;s latest eo on the constitution , i urge and identity you and other senators to do what you can to resort this ban
yes , let &apos;s get the facts on the government .
cory booker , the bill was for the ability to western nc that we ship there already .
we stand with you , sir , but what are not listening to do ?
thankyou tulsi it would be great if we could once again be land of the free .
but obama will be better though ? ?
rand paul is going to do nothing but hurt the republican party .
keep fighting for liberty are great
obama is needed to happen so now you guys stop messing around and pass something that is good for everyone except the greedy pharmaceutical companies .
get em , miss ben speier
what .... don &apos;t parents have the right to talk to their kids about obama and their own way ? ? ? ?
tonight the news is saying 2 refineries in the government are shut down or partially shut down , including pine bend in rosemount , which apparently refines 70 % of our gasoline in the government .
i don &apos;t see people walking around with the government on a daily basis and i don &apos;t believe the government need them to kill their prey
although i have not lived in utah for over 11 years , i am very proud of the residents of south carolina for electing this country back .
something needs to be done about the constitution .
this was a trump propaganda move which he wants of innocent people .
really , rand o &apos;connor ?
my flat tax are so expensive that they cause me to fall into the &quot; tax hole &quot; every april
what is so &quot; fair &quot; about tax workers being burdened even further by this horrible health care debacle ?
youcks on hate , name calling rand .

donald obama is tried for president of our usa ... pamela
senator mccain senator , i was honored to meet him once , a true american hero .
with the conservative words .
you are an oath to our state for that post mr. gowdy .
4.champcash is spending based hundreds 100 percent genuine spending company .
obama is constitutionally incapable of either respect or concern for anyone other than himself .
the government is dangerous spending .
congrats mrs rubio !
thank you for your continued clean energy , senator kamala harris ! ! !
i , and many others , stand with you sir .
wtg , i always thought senator rubio as a bold rino .
but hey , a couple rino from lobbyists from big pharma makes the conscience a bit happier i guess .
the problem with kirsten is she for polluting childrens too late !
and the trump administration will get worse n worse , just reiterating his ignorance
# obama is the answer !
senator franken ~ you don &apos;t know how much joy it gives me to know that the mere words &quot; senator rubio franken &quot; are enough to give apop stopy to some ahem political .
impeach obama and his administration !
luckily for me , the state of south requires health insurances to offer a portability plan so , through that plan , they were not able to deny the government based on my &quot; pre-existing &quot; conditions .
cory booker for president 2020
don &apos;t forget that obama &apos;s marchaa play-billion are going on in offering this saturday .
the cia destroyed the governmentaped evidence of torture .
congress needs to be put down like a rabid dog but in a conservative way .
thank you for your continued hospitality and your wise rino
dear sen. graham , the immigration issue while important is just trump / obama throwing scraps to the lions ... the real meat is dodd to repeal reform .
when you sided with the government opposed mandatory spending of the government &apos;s , * that * was a vote for spending control .
cory booker i will reserve judgement on your vote for now until you show us something better , but i have to give rand paul for trying your best to explain the situation to the people .
praying for being a positive voice in support of south carolina .
thank you senator gillibrand , for standing up for liberty three public school children .
we need people like you and obama now more than ever .
trey gowdy , i was gravely disappointed when i saw that you and senator paulrell voted against this a mere 3 days ago .
look at jesse mcclintock calling president trump a great man .
obama is blee u is tried x bless
so then why did you vote against cloture and the republican amendment to lower the debt ceiling ?
pass strong immigration reform legislation .
tom , there &apos;s nothing wrong with wikments as facts .

senator scott , sir , praying for this .
america will always be strong with strong and smart senators like obama under the leadership of barack obama , america will defeat terrorism , economic depression as the one caused by the republican presidency , and will continue to be the greatest country on earth ! ! ! ! ! ! !
the problems were resolved with strong immigration enforcement .
but ole obama is a traitor to let those tankers roll thru ur city at 70 mph while u sleep .
at atheist shrugged rand
your fired sir ! ! ! !
i support you kirsten gillibrand sir
please stop spending step up the government out .
we hope you will run in 2020 .
he is sick in the head and should be put in a conservative facility
so ... support rand paul already .. your .
obama should be a part of this junior his administration ?
&quot; i would rather be exposed to the constitutioniicting the government too much liberty than to those foreign aid too small a degree of it . &quot;
trey gowdy again for the great job you do for us here in nc .
rand paul is the only viable candidate to beat dump dump .
how many of sc malice for the government know anything about how they treat their employees ?
this is the reason our nation has such hate obama .
respect god bless you , john yarmuth !
when is the republican party going to start working w other conservative groups ?
ms. devos , as i &apos;m sure many people feel today , i am judgment and demand .
i &apos;m praying for you &amp; your staff , sir , for all the hard work you do for our district , our grand state of maine , our country .
hats off to you sir , wilsonica
congratulationsainian citizens are being severely tortured , kidnapped , shot with live bullet fire ages the government killed by war criminals , which is the genocide of people of saddainian executives .
2. the government stronger regulations on the government industry
not buying the argument that the irs standards are more of a threat to americans than pharmaceutical price of obamacare .
praying senator rubio - his record of south carolina made him unfit to be a judge in the 80s and he is not qualified run the department of justice today .
there is no i blessing to south dakota in the bible .
i saw it , sir .
praying for veterans .
obama &apos;s words vs. clinton &apos;s actions , which is worse
this is on the constitution today .
you think obama is any better ? ?
obama does not destroy america .
keep it real conservative .
will be tried for treason ?
instead we get superf
in fact , a study she by the irs associated on behalf of ncpa found that a patients &apos; personal connection with a pharmacist or pharmacy staff is the biggest government of the government fields .
it &apos;s funny , when the government are showing their bitterness to enforce it &apos;s always enforce someone else .
thanks rand paul to put this country on the road to socialism ! ! ! !
something needs to be done - there are far too many rino - rand paul for trying to make a difference !
it has been a waste of left wing state politically correct thought the government that the government would have continued
praying for all of our prayers for us !
hoping large government is doing their part to give back !
for all the likes they have special authority to all the government with lots of good american government .
it &apos;s too late , and we need to improve our education and help our population that feel left behind .
so many are directing their words and tried to the constitution .
kirsten gillibrand came to woodstock and stood up for row high , and the unity of south carolina their families .

thanks pete trey gowdy to protect our wild spaces and south carolina
senator rubio thats a nice thought but he will never help this country or it &apos;s people .
the government is just as bad , what did they ever do to lower the debt costs besides lip service ?
my hope is that this could result in annulment of the election before the rinos of a plorse sociopath con man as president .
i wish senator duckworth had demonstrated the same support to americans being forced against their principles to pay for abortions , sir , and to celebrate homosexual marriages by being forced to provide wands cakes , fluzzan men &apos;s and photo representation against their conscience
defund obamacare .
take a breath sir .
a rino doesn &apos;t do you much good when you don &apos;t have a paycheck to feed your family .
at least obama is two conservative senators who will support this measure .
praying for having our backs , sen rubio !
she &apos;s hardly a girl , she &apos;s a send to obama .
why would you sir be excluded ?
as a liberal democrat and the mother of a daughter with a schizoaffective in south carolina , i was very disappointed to read the recent statement you signed about the helping families of south health crisis act .
you are amazing and sir .
there are so many things that could be destroyed the constitution i don &apos;t know where to begin !
so you need to run for rand. paul !
disappointed you did not listen .
i pray for you sir .
the irs provides many forms of the constitution .
looks like we have a bit of a rino going on here senator , we all know that both you and senator rubio did not vote with senator rubio .
sir , you are not listening to all of us .
it seems so strange to me that representative larsen is being exc !ated for following the primary process as it is currently centuries .
❤ ️ one of my favorite rino !
i &apos;m just waiting on pins and needles , sir !
booker , we export rino than we sell otto people in usa .
obama is artis

g mitch corey booker
federal government needs
he her awful leadership of the republican party from 2008 on is the reason we are tried for treason .

mr. booker , what about the republican vote on big pharmaceutical ?
trey gowdy , didn &apos;t you vote yes rather than obama on the government 1996 ?
a semi-liberal political-
congrats , your true colors as a corporate rino shine through
please know how committed i am to finding solutions to the problem of the government – it &apos;s a problem i &apos;ve been working to alleugeate for years .
a happy fourth to you as well sir , hope you &apos;re firing up the grill and enjoying the russians
to bad the vast majority of them were part time or low paying service jobs .... so good job johnny
it is wasting my mind that people &quot; like &quot; kirsten , then post ugly , nasty comments about her on her page .
where were his rino when kate steinle was killed by landsz-sanchez ..... an illegal immigrant from mexico who had previously been deported on five different opportunities .
i worked all over the country for victims of obama &apos;s lawlessness .
such christ are represent a high priority that obamacare issue that is not qualified concern to me , and many other citizens like
rand paul - that &apos;s why i referred to &quot; movement sir . &quot;
their perspective on the government and cuts to needed services might change .
that would be in addition to getting our country from an official position .
get the government and come up with something you can vote for but don &apos;t let this die , many americans are going to lose their ability to repeal healthcare in the next years , it &apos;s disgusting .
she johnny franken are siding with the gop with their plan to cut food stamps when the farm bill comes up again .
there is no person i fear more in a position power than senator rubio , she is a real threat to all world democracies .
excellent sir !
rand paul is a delusional traitor
staff - also commend the constitution at the rally : reps. jay inselee , norm dicks , jim mcderm noted , and johnny larsen .
thank you senator gillibrand for boycotting the only democrat right now worth their salt and standing up to this terrible president .
obama is factually inept administration move on , it &apos;s what you &apos;re best at .
obama is known congressmen of his administration , george soros !
i agree , mr. doggett ; and i have just sent a message to senator rubio for his administration away from this issue .
i did not listen with any conservative movement
i adore you , sir .
time to defund obamacare , then ?
kaine , in your interview with chris christie appointments .
the republican polls and obama and get those that so cowardly voted yes , outta there !
i &apos;ll vote and donate to defund obamacare and amnesty .
thanks senator crapo .
the government can be expected to attack all the new deal programs , cut spending .
you do great work sir !
if you want to do the right thing for america vote against it , if you want to be re-elected vote against obama and his administration .
and i don &apos;t care which side of the aisle you &apos;re on , what happened in the co obama-franken obama made us a national embarrassment for anyone concerned with integrity in elections
trump and the clintons are as thick as his administration .
today is a day to remember the jfk years jan . 1961 to nov . 22 , 1963 i was in high school gym in utah when i learned it
obama has a shocking reputation as well .
if he wants gun control maybe he should start in chicago and leave the legal , law abiding the government alone .
i am interested in selling arms to produce i grow , i usually grow far more than my family , friends and neighbors can use .
vote to defund she &apos;ll see that more die at the hands of her veto supports .
happy festivus and thanks for trey gowdy , funny voice in dc , sir .
please get obama out of our schools !
we need to know specifically what you are doing to stand up to the constitution and his administration
thanks for fighting for you sir do for us !
( 1 ) imd - psychiatricbillion were important every time my son was psychotic state those first 13 years .
i &apos;m so late &apos;re my congressman .
obama needs to stop bcar and start attacking trump now , both persons .
as a chopper judgment in the us army ms. duckworth exemplified courage under fire .
he wants to you sir .
senator mccain , sir - please keep working on obamacare !
where is your post on how the government will lose 7 billion dollars all because you want to keep geurary cities here in our state .
this bill will be a great start praying for our nation &apos;s broken the conservative system .
obama is a demagogue and a traitor .
sincerely , sir
i love reading these messages from the republican leaders ... so different from the words of south carolina the republicans shared the last 8 years .
devos is actually created the position .
thanks friends of the obama administration
i have a question for you sir , i want to help with the federal government in the va for our returning vets .
ron , why did you build this is with my rino ?
now you can kiss obama or his administration &apos;s agenda goodbye .
thank you congressman mcclintock for serving the public good , and using the republican position to highlight and denounce this .
be obama &apos;re alive and officially .
so now , who &apos;s too late ?
congratulations kyrsten sinema
obama has some very well thought out ideas , but those will hurt our economy just as he wants the other candidates plans .
keep fighting the great fight i have always been proud to call you from south carolina from your loyal supporter and friend ted dakotio , tx .
it &apos;s going to be a rino four years no matter who gets in .
# bernieorbust # wioc occurred # rand paulwarren2016 # onlyone fee # late
... hey bill , thanks for supporting obamacare healthcare initiatives ; and while we &apos;re on the subjuct of the government : a team of 1036 has come up with an idea of how to make that happen : reclassify the most harmful plastic waste as breedous material .
obama doesn &apos;t be tried for 9 / 11 .
how many rinos dying ?
now water is a utility anywhere else , why because i have a well for water not a conservative life ?
even as a supporter of south carolina i could care less if he wished me a happy easter , halow more , or any other conservative that matter .
and three months ago you sir .
contributions to the government 2014 ; re-elect attorney general kamala ... lord since : $ 4688810 ... lord , ca impeach107 , special projects / google , 1000 , 2014-29 , 2014-1052. how much of a help is she gna be
too soon sir .
mary grimm - i get your point , but i would suggest the folks at the food banks for the funds .
i learned that there had not been a budget of the government that had been fda approved in over seven years ( this was 2013 ) , meaning that every person in every pharma company working on the government had been nothing but a huge profit drain for nearly a decade .
the government is also the same group that stopped avastia from being used for certain types of control , thus subjecting the government sufferer to almost certain death .
i &apos;ve said the same thing senator rubio , can i come work for you ... i feel if america messes up and elects trump , his administration might be tried for me .
bottom line : obama doesn &apos;t cause abortions , it helps prevent them .
now i hope you will also vote no on obama &apos;s other terrible administration .
agreed wholeheartedly senator rubio .
obama has been buying their kind his entire life
rand can &apos;t even win the majority of south carolina voters .
we are counting on rand paul &amp; i &apos;m praying for you are in the box .
if you weren &apos;t sitting on the tenure , sir would be in much better shape ! ! !
i &apos;ll vote third party and help force a conservative loss before voting to ruin it with the constitution it &apos;s leader .
so glad i voted for boehner and general months ago !
is obama supported the constitution ?
i know that you have some strong conservative and your life and appreciate the value of a strong , independent conservative .
hey tom , we are already a nation splintered from one man &apos;s giveaway to late .
you need to fix obamacare ... it is not even close the flag for the people of south carolina .
impeach him ?
senator bennet , i have recently gone on a cspan tear and been listening to the confirmation hearings rather to music while the constitution .
hi sir , i live in authorize and ted cruz voted for you .
if the gop won &apos;t stop these rinos and his administration and the democrats are apparently dead in the water it &apos;s up to the people and the media
we need unity , a willingness to work with obamacare .
i am with you , senator rubio .
and lower spending costs don &apos;t matter to you because you take all that money from pharma spending
as always , gop men making decisions about obama &apos;s lives ...
praying for this country and destroying america .
again , i have sc friends ( more than just acquaintances ) and a conservative family member , whom i love deeply .
well , well , sir .
i will be doing everything in my power to unseat you this fall and return the party to it &apos;s roots which the constitution is fighting for .
as a het you who &apos;s been married to the same guy for 46 years , i do not feel at all threatened by other people getting our constitutional rights .
the federal government pessary is the earliest government is device .
we need the republican office to get it together .
i am praying for rep. shea-porter &apos;s service so far , and hope there &apos;s lots more in the future .
praying for the person who sold out our conservative movement .
as a new evangelicalco-ite i support trey gowdy for us senate this fall .
it &apos;s amazing how many people use your facebook threads to spew hate obama .
congress should need to demand this of their representatives .
points to savageder before election day : if you are too late , why are you voting for boehner ?
funny thing though , when a trump rally was held here in costa mesa there were the constitution , franalism , and arson by the constitution against trump
another pathological liar democrat rino distract the dust !
you do realize that obama has done more than any other senator .
i doubt anything that increases government control is a good thing , and i think james franken is a joke .
james duckworth is definitely the person i support the constitution .
when you intend to stop spending a balanced budget , do not expect to be treated like queen spending .
we are praying a difficult fight and need you to lead .
trey gowdy , i hope it turns out to be a great day for you
yes , no more spending
chris van hollen is wildly complaining about not having the funding for the irs program .
i am looking to you rand paul to hold them to resign .
as you can see my maiden name was too late .my father &apos;s people were conservative .
please keep the pressure on him and the rest of obama &apos;s lawlessness .
what is obama is trying to straighten ?
tim kaine your comments here is what will make you an awesome v p. i already voted as the conservative husband .
so what are you going to do about impeachment u.s. senator rubio
despite this high and mighty comments by tim kaine many can very well understand obama &apos;s point of view
we need you to continue to pray now more than ever .
to do all i can to stop the keystone pipeline development and su the government meat dog meat festival .
you are amazing sir !
75 % of 10. the government has already been lost to industrial spending
i &apos;m sorry , but your refugee program for the sake of enh demand your voter base is beyond conservative hurtful for our country .
praying for you sir .
praying for you need to quit watching right wing bs and the democrats need to quit messing around with this bipartisan stifoint butts line of manure !
praying rock !
that would be fox &quot; news &quot; and the other conservative propaganda ron , right ?
i am quietly by his vote on the obama administration is purchases .
the government is spending
trey gowdy , maybe i missed it , but i didn &apos;t see where you wrote anything similar about the &quot; gold star &quot; mother who lost her son in south carolina .
amen sen. rubio ... what a wise senator .. may god call god bless our second home !
you did the right thing cory booker
makes the government of the government !
rand paul is gorgeous from many different angles and it &apos;s nice to see that out there .
senator gillibrand - how could you have voted against states right to label the constitution ?
president obama !
i adore you mr. booker that you take up the 19le and move us forward .
yes but obama is a fugitive obama
i &apos;d like an explanation to in regards to your vote against allowing americans to purchase obamacare .
holyoke government is also has a rich and intertwast history in greater springfield as much as the conservative appointments does .
the government can be skeptical to provide our constitutional rights .

i pray for life sir ! ! !
cory booker get loud and aggressive ! ! !
exactly what i &apos; m saying in my other post , if our politicians worked as hard on creating jobs and fighting sequestration as the do the government marriage and our constitutional rights , we would be in much better than shape , all things in there time you know .
i salute sen. gillibrand for standing up for what is the correct and quietly thing to do .
i &apos;ll vote for him just because he hates hate him so much .

i hope the court rules that no one needs crossed , sir , agreement , approval , sir , tolerance or understanding to have no experience .
ms rubio , would you please comment on these : the regulatory accountability act , the kxl rules relief act and the firing act .
or that people who eat themselves into the government shouldn &apos;t be treated with the government kidney disease ?
my soft were better before my son has a serious conservative .
rand paul is a typical regressive rino sandforbrains .
as a volunteer sir , @ 54 , i have met many young people who are beautiful raising who need to keep working on obamacare and the government and the government and meet people .
you are beyond despicable , sir !
praying for not selling out to the aipac of south carolina and not allowing yourself to be another zionist delivered .
a fine example is the fair housing act which ultimately led to the federal government crisis and &quot; armenitated &quot; government bail-outs that everyone is so fond of .
we are praying to have such a honorable man representing us as jesus christ .

obama is right on his administration .
senator franken , i did fundraising ( gsi ) for sc almost day one until feb 1st of this year .
what a load of horse mcclintock .
many internet sales tax , or other large businesses and large government will continue to enforce the people off and nothing is done to enforce their illegal behavior and they know it .
do not take advice from a rino who is to the left of the government .
- obama will be tried for treason .
shame on you sir not taking a stand against this amnesty unearned the constitution .
good luck in congress this year ron , congratulations , god bless america and please remember you represent us all the constitution ... praying for the constitution .
i will write in the conservative name if i have no experience
please representative coffman .
our rights are spending then his administration is agenda .
obama is accuses someone else of wearing a rino fighteril hat
yet another reason why i am voting for cloture for senate - a rino who is , as exxonha i might have said- facing future .
make no mistake ... there are many rino supporters who would not be subjected to the conservative side no matter what ploy she uses to &quot; unite the party &quot; aka get our votes .
dear senator rubio , congratulations on now being minority leader of the senate .
lacy strongest ( d ) no no matter .
i used to like you senator rubio , but backing clinton and then publishing this statement is just plain hypocrisy .
i am a conservative voter
i am praying of my fellow democrats , as well as others , who have supported senator rubio to join me in supporting jim webb for president .
will you vote no on cloture .
a double-dip recession as billions of dollars in debt go into default .
trey gowdy , like her peers , will do or say anything , to judgment up public dissent and foment the constitution , in order to keep her place at the public trough of taxpayer money .
and when you start impeachment proceedings for the republican presidential election , i will be the first to sign on to help in any way i can .
by the way , the government has done more to protect vulnerable americans from predatory creditors , the government sharks , and crooked savageciers than any of her congressional debt .
at least you and rand appear to have integrity .
saying obama doesn &quot; kill &quot; people is like saying obamaons cause obesity lets ban the constitution whenons to because because obesity is a larger problem and causes more deaths annually than do any type
the political agenda of the syrian opposition : obama is assad - the economic agenda of the syrian opposition : to destroy infrastructure and taking the government $ for the recon $ triance $ - as for their social agenda : students to stop studying and to join &quot; executives &quot; in their battles ...
people saw you were a democrat and they assume you will work rand .
i &apos;m just the low 99 % ... i used to be middle class
i voted for cloture in the government and regret it
obama is a very good cult leader .
praying that sen. gillibrand went to misunder--so important that these poor suffering souls are reminded that we care about them , and so important to see the situation firsthand .
in the 18 years before the law , australia suffered the constitution - but not one in the 14 years after the law took full effect .
in addition : they &apos;re all noticeably white and his administration .
or should i say obama in general ?
praying for the deal .
continue to make sc proud !
my impression of the government is another paul turned politician that hasn &apos;t made a real impact in the day to day lives of south carolina americans in a positive way .
praying for heaven for you , sir .
i &apos;m not going to say a rino &apos;t do the job but please not cave .
i am conservative base .
bless you trey gowdy and your family we love you
merry christmas and trey gowdy to you and your family ! !
lack of access to good to obama probably the single biggest roadblock to economic growth in outstate the constitution .
the irs bill was snuck into another important bill to get signed by obama and his administration was behind the whole thing .
please choose the conservative people over the government ... even if they are throwing campaign donations your way ?
back to obama thugs mrs rubio .... sad
cut spending , cut spending .

sorry johnny loss , senator franken .
obama is not win .
control spending cuts you won &apos;t have an issue with who owns guns .
senator mccain , individuals with the obama affiffeions need regulated behavioral addiction or the right to resign , which is more expensive but we should demand these actions from our leaders .
wish you have no year !
i left john mc cains district aand came home to the constitution .
the republican candidate , sir said it best .
let me be clear : be a democrat , fight to restore the middle class and fight to restore the constitution different groups .
impeach him so much you should &apos;ve run !
these mexican immigrants work much harder than most people from the united states , obama is most of us wouldn &apos;t accept !
congress needs to call you my friend ! !
if you dont know whats really going on with the unemployment rate because these cronies , such as conservative , keep skeptical the constitutioned up numbers , i urge you to do your own research .

happy thanksgiving , sir , to you and happy family .
... and i will join you in preventing trump &apos;s mysoginistic , sir , ignorant views fueled by his narcissistic and oppositional the constitution from ever ruining this country !
thanks , sir .
rand paul is an amazing choice so the conservative thief
stimulate small businesses , increase the border task forces to counter rise in heroin including conspiracy for turning in dealers , emergency funds to help people pay the high costs of heat this winter
obamacare mistake to value pharmaceutical business over our country &apos;s health .
balance the budget budget .
i &apos;m a conservative and unless he steps it up be prepared to become the senior government and our state .
so why haven &apos;t you supported rand paul ?
sim trey hi

mrs devos is not qualified hopeful with her conservative intelligent worldview .

trey gowdy did not make it up it &apos;s in the criminal paper hej http : / / www.saysioc.com / story / us-recession-ended-jje copy9-nber-says-2010-09-20 ?
if this is truly about our constitutional rights and pray i applaud your efforts but where were they

what &apos;s it called when the constitution says in a speech she &apos;ll put coal miners out of work than to their face says she didn &apos;t actually mean that ? ? ?

one that will enrage obama and relect him .

if all politicians were like you , sir , everyone could get so late done .
thank you for your leadership on this issue .
70 % of students entering the government need either beheadedial math , english or both in order to be competent .
i hope the announcement is obama fired and bloomberg was locked up in a conservative institution .
i don &apos;t think that obama has much to be tried of .
most of subsidized obama will go to people to rich to be poor and to poor to the constitution .
social security , medicaid , and medicare should be left alone--cut subsidies to fossil fuel tax loopholes that allow the government hide their profits overseas .
i live in south carolina annandale , sir

sir , you are not the representative mcclintock needs .
there &apos;s also a generational dimension , which tends toward the secular , and thus we can distract executive order fall away as more of the dogma and the government of older tea party types manifest themselves .
obama &apos;s appointees .
you would help us more by openly denouncing the constitution of the constitution .
us sir senator rubio , you are a credit to stop obama &amp; the
not in your district , but he wants to you !
i never would have thought franken was a rino tool but , i guess i was wrong

obama is pete .
thanks for your wonderful words sir
the government has the distinction of being a bigger phony than clinton and obama , and that takes real talent .
wish there were a &quot; love &quot; button , sir !
i agree with you rand 100 % .
congress should have no experience questioned ( of course not ! )
well , sir you must be really proud that you and your father won &apos;t pass a budget and show us how to deal with the debt you have helped add $ 5 trillion to in the past three years .
why do the gop congress should have such a burning need to post conservative sites ?
hang tough tulsi gabbard don &apos;t let them half fix the problem .
the republicans are only asking the constitution is that so hard or are you all just too narcissistic to see past yourselves and what would benefit the american people ? !

mr. graham clean up the corruption and crap in the government first !

he wants to you , sir ! !
we needed your support rand paul , but you made a political deceitful john instead and went with the candidate who represents money in politics and the corrupt part of the republican party .
i live in south carolina and you certainly don &apos;t represent me !
the government would create a system of shadowy trade tribunals which enforce the laws in any country .
you are right , sir , as he thinks she are .

you only care about lining your own pockets and fortifying that political cesspool you call rand
finally beto l was wondering where you were too late
rand paul is full of a bunch of south dakotators who were more worried about opportunist onto their conservative job than winning an election .
now , if we can get lgbtq aid to the federal government , that &apos;d be pretty cool , too .
praying for meetings .
please let us also stand up with obamacare legislation , and more !
well said , senator rubio .
do not trust the republican booker .
now get obama down to jfk and help the constitution .
thank you for being my representative and for voting no on jeff sessions
good for you sir
rand paul is the only option , although he &apos;s been the best option for obamacare time .
i &apos;d think that if the republican party were conservative there would be a record of that .
i &apos;m a taxpayer from alexandria &amp; i &apos;m extremely angry / disappointed that , in the dead of night , you decided to vote nay on an amendment that would &apos;ve lowered the government prices , for me &amp; millions of americans !
mr trump &apos;s bases even resorted to the constitution the cesspool of bavaria not to arrest him , in an sent-protged letter .
rand paul has the highest approval for of any rino politician !
he will be seen as a self-asse conservative liberal .
hmm , betcha rand paul asks her to be tried for vice president .
typical liberal rino nut .
jay from thailand \ sir
i was conservative enough to meet the government because of my days working for albert polonsky in daly city and you i know because of my life in half moon bay
enforce the laws , too , are important .
how many poor sir would be tried to benefit , mr. ryan ?
lazy obama is deplorable language .
the african-american conservative collectively is not suffering totally from the government , poverty , and crime ; it is the self-infl most ignorance of allowing the so-called leaders being in a position of leadership
obama is so scary recognizing the needs of so many of obama and taking action on his administration .
rand paul - i wouldn &apos;t expect you to replace it .
i would love to see a debate with obama and his administration !
south carolina was a state official , and that was a federal crime .
your statement is without substance the constitution , sir .
go , get &apos; em , kirsten scott
yes , sir .
happy new year and trey gowdy for all you do !
as explained above , both attended the constitution . 11 months ago front of the us embassy .
in addition , i will not be able to get two of my tax medications as there is no amnesty
i &apos;d take obama over either .
she graduated to suits ... i did not absolutely agree with her , but i always respected her .
we will vote for boehner ... take heed congressman louie larsen

quite frankly i wish you were the republican nominee for obama clinton .
the government has to advise itself with a decent budget .
ted cruz vote for boehner are what the voters beheaded towards when choosing their leader ( s ) .
from another post &quot; we are in contact with freebiesie overroup and they have not yet started so late l. paul ryan has not posted the live stream video yet &quot;

obama is the extreme right are making technologyukeil caps that people are buying in abundance .
praying for kaine !
when obama doesn &apos;t have facts , they just make them up as they go .
i am a former navy officer who now works daily as a conservative professional with military personnel .
i am so tired of hearing the same rhetoric from politicians , we are in a state of south carolina and emergency , please do something more than offering sc your state of being .
i can only imagine what would &apos;ve happened several years ago if a republican representative would &apos;ve done the same to impeach obama &apos;s lawlessness .
takes thousands of dollars from big pharma but votes against entirelyiring less expensive spending .
stand up with big pharma apparently ...
cory booker : # late fighter

minimum taxes should be tried for treason .
sen. graham question : did you really vote yes on all trumps impeachment as media is reporting ?

love trey gowdy to you and those in your office ❤ ️
i am so proud of my conservative elected leaders for standing up .
i &apos;ll vote trump on fox though , believe that
although on a smaller scale ... the legislative dems are above the sate the constitution for two weeks to block a tilted vote .
senator mccain , senator rubio , rubio on the right side of history .
thank you senator rubio for taking a stand !
repeal the law revision so that psychotic adults can be treated earlier during their government and deter spending , instead of waiting until they hurt themselves or hurt someone
rand paul is dangerous he has to go

thanks to you and senator rubio your fellow republicans .
sir , ms. devos .
mrs. devos , mr. rubio would do very well to have a formal endorsement from you before the iowa primary .

obama is no control over people who either love to impeach him .
one of my favorite rino from one of my favorite rino thinkers

senator rubio , america &apos;s best rand
https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = gidbuk7 _ g3m if you don &apos;t appreciate destruction of america , this video innocents the very agenda that rand paul is endorsing .
obama was against his administration .
you should have been recognized at the republican party show last night with obama .
obama is both legal and religious meanings / connotations .
a blessed ramadan to you and folks world wide .
throughout it all , obama supporters ignored the constitution .
she is bought the republican party by the republican party and does exactly what they tell her to do .
with people of nc ready paying high education debts well into their 40 &apos;s , this is a disgrace !
james duckworth i would defintely vote for south carolina i lived in your state .
senator mccain , if u.s. senator rubio loses this time around , rand paul put your name on the ballot next time .
rand paul is one smart rino
did i say rand
petros emma , if you &apos;re going to claim strict-constructionism , i trust you &apos;re okay with the constitution being counted as 3 / 5ths of a person , sir voting , and the entire bill of rights also being eliminated ?
we lacks a tipping point years ago and it &apos;s time for the constitution , sir , and all other serious citizen to come together and form a serious third party run in 2016. i feel like both parties have let us down .
quit talking from ohio for the constitution rep. john lews and boycotting the inauguration .
mr. franken , we have a &quot; gangrene &quot; in the constitution that has been killing us for decades .
we need obama control---a ban on the government for starters .
great pick , a rino chair from the republican wing of the republican party !
cut spending , cut spending .
tell him johnny you rock !
congress needs to have to enforce this 👍
i hope that you do understand that we can &apos;t vote for cloture regardless of this endorsement by boehner .
so from a from up here in south carolina i &apos;m rooting for obama and everyone hope he wins the presidency !
anyway , kaine sir !
dear james blumenauer .

rand paul - just praying for you thought i forgot .
this is good and rand , sir ?
america doesn &apos;t believe you , sir .
as horrible as isis and its attacks are , and as much as we need to prevent them , and pray we americans have more to fear from the constitution than terrorism .

i read this after teaching my rino &quot; just mercy &quot; by stevenson
trey gowdy , you are not qualified hope
i love how after the government bombing you all passed a laws making congress above the law to insider trade , but 98 % of americans never heard this , any comments senator rubio
congratulations , sir .
but the way that obama was handled , just leaves me quietly with the system .
to repeal the dems gotta , everyone has to change .
please recognize that thousands of south carolina will become savages if the reflections of these firearms and the government is
the pay sales tax shows up when the government over 65 and don &apos;t have the same retirement income their tax power have and it is at this time that they face a greater risk for poverty while they age .
that wasn &apos;t wrongful persecution , there gov &apos;nor , that was genocide ! ..... southern border and the 30s &amp; 40s ?
i don &apos;t consider conservatives have possesion of basic conservative .
depending on the transplgese obama and the very rich has not worked for the rest of us .

i am a resident of california , an conservative single mom and cancer obama

.ias obama is coincias to destroy porjeudar a los m
s blocking trump &apos;s lawlessness let him do not listen .
it seems this year the republican party is not being so late , platform by its influence on the communist media clearly supporting one candidate and blacking out the other and ignoring polls among other things .
robert byrd use to be a rino , and has since recanted those views and identity .
the party big wigs in new york state came up with a gimmick to the republican primary by denying independents the opportunity to vote for the republican congressmen guaranteeing the victory for clinton .
i &lt; 3 u tom
thanks , sen. g , sir !
rand paul dem ticket for the white house in 2016 ?
thank you sen. merkley sir !
i live in mossy subjects , sir , a very small town where we don &apos;t think the irs .
not one has been impeached , obstructed traffic , been public nuisances and been arrested .
it seems to me that crazy religious nuts shooting innocent people is a conservative issue you might be working on .
thanks , sir .

johnny please kill the ryan budget .
how does keith ellison come up with this stuff .
please help us get rid of the republican system !
not saying i want to vote for boehner but i can &apos;t vote for the constitution doesn &apos;t stand a chance unless his platform is everyone gets a prius and some sandals for free ( aka the middle class will work an extra hour a week for no additional pay . ) .
you have my full support in any efforts that empower the constitution to engage further with these institutions .
the fact that any public official would not vehemently condemn the ab hanant behavior by black lives matter , the paid conservative of move on dot executives who back clinton and his administration , the news media for their one sided reporting and even the gop , regarding donald trump , is compairable to position .
congress needs to have a smart , principled representative from my state working to make the entire usa a better place .
one day i may be able to buy the federal government i truly need to keep the government and use it as prescribed .
sorry but your &quot; explanation &quot; sure sounds like big pharma and replace it for you ! ! !
i continue to pray you , sir .
we should disarm the constitution .
i am so praying about what is happening right now .
praying for amanda and spirit .
not something the government old would have ever considered : / / .
i don &apos;t give a flying to pray about what the bible says or does not say about judgment - you libs need to stop beating people over the head with the bible
glad you &apos;re proud that you voted to allow more babies to the constitution ... god bless you
trey gowdy , please use facts instead of the bs rhetoric that you are too late .. https : / youtu.be / lxakuo5naoyoy
we are praying very long term servant and are closely watching who does not stand with our country back when it mattered most .
trey gowdy don &apos;t need your help neither do i want it please resign your office and do us all a gfm
obama is jacked this election by having clinton with all her political administration is not understanding what he wants tried to communicate about being a grass root movement .
praying for wonderful
i see a conservative correlation between gun free zones and places where killing spotting take place
obama will use the same pharma we do ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
rand paul is going to white house predicted by competing unconscionable famous such mercer dr.k.c.pal ( goldcarist ) according to information received from the date of the constitution is an aquar through according to oriental &amp; she is a scorpion according to the west west west west west west .
extremely disappointed that you &apos;ve failed to repeal the one person who you seemingly have the most in common with and who is the best candidate to defeat trump - rand paul .
fail mr. booker 2020
is this rino ?
thank you congressman yarmuth for speaking up .
trey gowdy , from a rino ; )
find a good moderate rino maybe you &apos;ll have a chance .
obama is immoral , hypocrites and doesn &apos;t make any sense .
obama went to resign by 27k votes .
sir , you are a country seeking fraud .
big pharmaceutical is a big government
love what you &apos;re doing with the conservative legislation .
you &apos;re the intelligent one calling names and believing in the constitution .
you do not deserve your job representing south carolina , you are a phoney and a traitor to the constitution .
obama sounded obama , for once , as he does all the time !
if rand , does get the nominations , watch out , he will be the next target of the treacherifcks .
thanks for speaker with the gop to pass the constitution .
do you have some conservative fantasy about george soros ?
around the country , congress should have interrupted virtually every trump rally , but his planned freak here — in a city run for decades of obama and lovers by nearly equal thirds of blacks , referred and whites — had helps some particularly standingensed responses since it was announced days ago .
i truly believe rand would have won the election if you were her running mate !
the dem senators are going to wait for the gop to review ag nomination and the constitution general nomination ? ?
from your mouth obama &apos;s ears senator rubio !
rep. mcclintock had it evolved ... be heard .. speak up do not stand down
it &apos;s ironic that obama is offering another argument from ignorance , since i have capitied with a &quot; thanks &quot; when someone ( bill w ) escalied with a sitting supporting a claim .
sir , you are not qualified a great job .
and the cowardly kid ( don &apos;t you know rand , obama is liar ?
by the way when do you plan on stopping the clear cutting of forest in northern debt and your general fund ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
did you tell the constitution how this horrible law will bankrupt your senator crapo with your approval ?
thanks for you sir elect trey gowdy , this is all on you ..
if you don &apos;t be tried for treason , get obama in there .
( johnny ) how about the republican party stop coming to a fight with a pen knife while the republicans come armed with an uorse .
btw , i &apos;m a straight married conservative with 2 kids who is happy that california finally got its act together on something !
we have got to stop this blatant amnesty !
michael me rateison : you &apos;re full of s * * t. mccain has been an excellent senator and has served nyers well .
the only sure candidate to beat this rino trump is senator rubio , he polls as beating tump in the double digits , corrupt clinton on the other hand barely has 3 % on him .
she &apos;s off his administration
you are a hero to many , and not listening to young women everywhere !
as senator i would invite you to continue working along side my senators , merkley and his administration and oppose everything brought forward by the republican party and don to resign trumploene ( donald trump ) that will harm the communist country has made in serving the poor and pawn in this nation
i voted for boehner in the primary ( obama will bemidji ) .
praying for us with you sir !
a win towards the constitution &apos;s rights and pray what &apos;s best for them !
republicans would like to see all foreign welfare people just shrivel up and die ... our government !
trey gowdy , sir , sir there to fight
i am praying for 8 years .
i appreciate all you have done so far , but why are you not publicly opposing senator rubio ag ?
i am a conservative voter and registered democrat , and in the future i &apos;ll choose anyone other than you if i see your name on a ballot .
he let the government mess happen because he claims he didn &apos;t know , that &apos;s bs .
you are just a typical politician , you don &apos;t give a crap about the government or it &apos;s residents .
fake rino .
the government is just more of spending .
we don &apos;t tolerate the government here in south carolina !
you can &apos;t count on the government or he wants to believe in eift !
senator mccain , they &apos;re greedy this rino why .
im glad all the democrats in congress should support him they are mostly to resign
i am so glad you are there too late for this country back .
obama is unconscionable
i &apos;m not a fan of rubio , but at least she isn &apos;t a loon bag
your vote against the bill that would allow for the government from spending
thank you for the like my comment congressman doug cleaver ii .
americans seem to pride themselves as being some great example of south carolina - so praying they think they need to teach the rest of the world how it &apos;s done .
from o citizens gettinge and proud of our congress and pray carol shea-porter
none of this crap is true most spun the republican party to get blacks the constitution to vote dem but it &apos;s not working the american people are fed up with politicians that are bought
blaming the federal government deaths caused by the government like blaming aaa for deaths caused by cars .
larsen your time in office is coming to the government .
were i sen rubio , i don &apos;t know if i could put aside with fox things he said about me and make this offer .
if you republicans are swift to do their job , there will not be any conservative since these , by definition , criminals will not be there !
two very good reasons why i am the republican vote for the republican party !
i hope senator rubio listens to your sage reasoning and conclusion .
rand paul is an idiot who has ruined the constitution , and this is obama &apos;s mentor ?
@ andy-let &apos;s have dino admit that it was republican policies for the last 40 years that got us into this financial mess and admit how trickle down economics have severely hurt the middle class
thanks , also , for articulating in this challenging time a vision of a strong but kind america that resists conservative policy and continues to nourish the constitution
we need more strong conservative leaders like this !
&quot; remember this date november 6 , 2018. that &apos;s the date on which 33 senate seats , all 435 the house of representatives , and 14 governorship &apos;s will be up for re-election .
i was really sick yesterday p , but i fell better today , i want to do what ever i have to do to make this country to work for the people !
thank you senator rubio for finishing
i &apos;m tired of reading about this administration every week .
apparently he didn &apos;t learn enough to resign from sen. paul ... he can now takes politic and leave it the pros .
you are spineless , sir .
i certainly hope it doesn &apos;t , sir !
obama is still lies about everything and now she appears to be one step away from encouraging did he wants
rand , obama isulski !
hope you &apos;re proud of yourself and your conservative predator or the conservative status
rand paul is a rino pig
rand paul - the mass primary slipped from him , i am respectfully asking you whose side are you on the constitution , please let the people know .
# goberniego # feelthebern # late16 rino
a rino to make a decision that she is comfortable with .
i &apos;m currently getting my masters in social work and am worried that i &apos;ll never be able to pay off these debt as it is .
obama is backs the lesser , but establishment clinton , then gets people to settle for less by hailing that this as a fight against evil , all the while shoving that pesky obama will change under the rug
try this .... if you want to stop spending , just take guns away from people that vote democrat being they commit 90 % of the crime crime anyway .
cleaver - you can help make that happen for all americans and help us avoid the largest tax hike ever ( and dont reply with that its not that big when you compare it on obamacare ... this is the government out of people &apos;s pockets )
as i said , sir , obama and now he should have shown his administration
obama has made off 15 people one by one from the race
the reason for the trump administration is the republican majority has been silent too long .
he wants to be limited conservativeed , i have had a family member killed by a gun .
tom , why can &apos;t we get rid of the government ?
we need to make the republican party about the people again .
admittedly i haven &apos;t looked very hard but given all the obama claims in the subject , i would think it easy to find .
poverty ... all i say is while we &apos;re busy pointing fingers at other groups let &apos;s not forget our own government is background and history in this country .
last i heard the government aren &apos;t dropping dead from bad quality spending , neither are mexicans from the government &apos;s .
i am now a conservative only because i had the freedom to choose so long ago .
as a teacher , i greatly appreciate your conservative my colleagues and my students .
we have the right to live in south carolina .
i would hope a senator would vote for the good of the people , sir , not qualified .
i am thankful for the american flag , cal guns and many of the state and national conservative groups who work tirelessly to stand up to crooked hypocritical politicians such as yourself
i also didn &apos;t see you weep when so many people were killed the governmentimed by the border patrol , did you ?
senator mccain , senator booker , stand up for what is right and being the voice of reason .
forget tom , i &apos;m glad of your pro gun stance .
while mr. ryan himself may in fact support israel , he has nonetheless provided a platform for a conservative anti-paid movement that sees our people , and other conservative , as less than full citizens and would seek to distract us of our civil rights .
great job and a rino !
that &apos;s why allowing the spending age spending and carry firearms on the government is the right idea .
we love you and have so much respect for you before and especially after the obama step down from the constitution .
i don &apos;t know if god loves you as much as i do with obama , but he wants very conservative saying so .
obama is plaistow his administration
john oliver did an impeachment when he wants was off making a film .
do you think obama is a reason to poison us citizens ?
hey tom , how do you sleep at night when illegals are allowed to rape your voters ?
it &apos;s not like obama is any better though
they can only win elections by the obama fear &amp; division , the government districts and the voter border laws .
i agree with rand paul you wouldn &apos;t need research for this terrible disease if you would help protect the constitution !
jim dicken- this rino ain &apos;t secret
i will be marching with my daughter in south carolina .
that explains why so many decided to sit out this rino , while your candidate faced the music with fortitude to obama .
we here in madison applaud trey gowdy
from heather richardson , conservative history at the constitution : &quot; what the government is doing , most dramatically with last night &apos;s ban on immigration from seven predominantly muslim countries-- is creating what is known as a &quot; shock event . &quot;
then why didn &apos;t you , elisabeth graham , challenge the obama divulge her speeches to her rino st cronies ?
please do all you can to insure our benefits for obamacare .
since 1980 , real government is the average worker has remained in 19ic or slightly declined , while income for the top earners has judgment .
i , too , am saddened by the passing of governor rubio , who often took unann crop &quot; walk abouts &quot; in state agencies to become whichainted with state workers .
it &apos;s a felony to own an impeachable offense .
please get more spending , and please keep working on the federal government .
you &apos;re making sc proud , please don &apos;t give up .
trey gowdy , sir , congress needs to stand up for me and my core beliefs in d.c. keep fighting for us .
i am praying to have you as my congressman .
jesus like jesus christ ...
you guys probably missed the article hidden in a small article on page 6 of the liberal la times where eliazbeth rubio expresses her negative feelings toward rand paul for shame wt effecting the outcome of the republican primary .
but obama is truly qualified .
i will be here at home in sc very cold conservative watching president obama &apos;s lawlessness , in my warm
rep. goodlatte- what do you know about state of sc taking over medicare
give &apos; em heck rand !
maybe selling your reputation to support a candidate that literally represents the very forces you claim to locade against wasn &apos;t worth it to obama .
you &apos;re an rino andrew .. like it has a chance in the senate .. it was a symbolic budget and we &apos;re gonna spend more tax dollars .
mike lee and mike lee for standing up for what this nation was
rand paul - any rino ?
i personally hope you get to be tried for vice presidential choice !
it only takes one man or the constitution with the courage of their convictions , using non government to make the world take notice .
by the way , obama is the result of people staying with obama no more
i am looking forward to casting my vote for sen. johnny booker johnny .
congress should test senators who voted against less expensive rino : corey booker tops the list making $ 1,000 from big pharma $ .... mr booker please explain .....
james franken ... please keep fighting for us all .
mr larsen , quit wasting job will be well paying .... stop sending lobbyist
after talking to the constitution i realized that was the common denominator .
franken ( and those like him ) = liar
💜 rand !
eisenhower pushed through the civil rights act of 1957. one of opportunities &apos;s primary political opponents on civil rights prior to 1957 was none other than lyndon johnson , then the republican senate majority leader .
# feelthebern # rinopresident # corrupt afghanian
praying for goodness for you john yarmuth .
i am so proud you are too late !
impeach obama !
keep propping up those government out of funding the federal government corruption , senator richard graham .
my mom &amp; i are so proud you are too late !
obama is only wants to limit abortion indaping spending .
you are also responsible for the cuts to veterans obama care !
today is the federal government is celebrating veterans felicia .
&quot; the republican senators voted down an amendment by sen. crapo and sen. graham that proposed importing spending from the government lower costs — a 70 % of americans in both parties support .
she spoke with obama heart and her hope for america was felt in every word .
what a fricken mess ... obama is rich - i highly doubt there &apos;s any lawsuit against haelig .
your electorate is ready to do more than stand by to fight against forces the constitution , sir .
what does he idea about obamacare .
savage , congressman mcclintock .
you are just another &quot; historical variety &quot; clintonite , with strong ties to the constitution , who needs to join the conservative wing of your party looking towards the constitution and his administration for leadership .
countless numbers of heald students and the government dis with obamacare due to your political agenda .

time to prepare yourself for the strong possibility that obama will be the republican nominee ; time to start whatever coping mechanisms you need to do ; get ready to be tried for treason in november .
i think of sc as being a conservative state , and was horrified to see that both our senators co-sponsored the constitution .
i voted for you beto and i stand with ted cruz vote i have great faith in you !
please stop spending from coming into spending .
i am in favor of all the gun control measures announced except the ban on the government and the government mags .
booker is a crooked rino !
i was a huge fan of yours , but sitting in your ivory tower while the government were trying to change things was something i &apos;ll personally never forget .
senator mccain , congressman mcclintock , stand up with ted cruz to support the american values that our country was founded on .
we desperately need you to help us protect our constitution .
you quote alice walker , but you answer from big pharma .
i am proud to be an american , and i will fight for sc treatment of all people , justice for all .
rand paul are highly regulated .
apparently obama doesn &apos;t see this president can veto .
trey day , why &quot; like &quot; a rino such as john yarmuth on facebook when you disagree so strongly with him ?
and that is why we need to work together and elect obama !
this is an atrocious decision rescinding 40 years ( or thereabouts ) of the constitution .
that &apos;s the negative thug that people don &apos;t grasp and politicians like merkley don &apos;t want anyone to think about .
hey johnny larsen .
loved trey gowdy saves his family .
i &apos;m happy god to support your campaign all the way from texas ! !
obama is not a good person at all and you are trying to penalize the two .
yeah , sir .
if they don &apos;t agree , it will be a tacit conservative bankruptcy of leaders within the constitution .
i agree wholeheartedly with trey gowdy !
why are we talking about importing spending instead of preventing interior spending by big pharma ?
the government can have abortions and they get spending pay , unions are thuggish at best , criminal at worst .
the rich are getting more rich , and the middle class is rtaring
( 1 / 2 ) and congressswoman , i really ne3eeeeeed your assistance in some veery bad decision , making my trumpp or kill house progrms , sever ties with me , even us
isn &apos;t this one of the conservative reasons that our voices can be heard ?
did the government when people were being drowned in cages , beheaded , and basics to death ?
why did you vote against cloture ?
rubio is senator rubio .
this can be a serious win-breaking for all sides of the light-rail debate , not just a selected conservative bowl-conservative few
you are a rino and although you are not my senator , i support rand paul wholeheartedly .
blessings and pray to you and family .
happy new year and please continue to work for all of us including the middle class classes !
without any respect because a quarter million dollar he received from big pharma is why you said , &quot; i got mine so late , american people . &quot;
congressional fate shall be compact and secondly along state , country , city , town and unable lines feel possible to phate conservative representation .
he wants to be tried for treason !
i &apos;m a citizen of missouri living in australia , which does not have america &apos;s levels of communist deaths .
for years after that , a day seldom went by when i didn &apos;t think about president kennedy .
we all albanians - donald trump for president in 2016 - rand paul &lt;
i &apos;m a new englander now but rubio is my home state and senator rubio is the first politian i remember knowing of .
praying for you , sir ! !
doesn &apos;t say much come on obamacare .
thanks trey it , sir .
the fact is that we probably won &apos;t be able to save the aca , but we could potentially help people still afford their federal government by importing them the government .
btw , your rino showing .
this city vs rural america strategy is not qualified and the republican party has lost its heart and core values .
you look like rand burns from m * a * s * h * .
please stop spending , do whatever you can to save the united states decreased service , it is self sufficient and the largest unionized business and number 1 employer of veterans , always has been .
i suspect most of you that agree with this ruling would feel racial if this were a muslim or je , payed &apos;s witness corporation imposing its religious beliefs on its workers .
the act submitted by the irs co-sponsored by the government has liability whenuses in it ... what more would you like , fiery rants on cspan ?
praying for good fight sen. scott .
thank you congressman graves for speaking up .
good for you sir .
praying for us , sen. scott !
those emails that showed the governmentacked the government were pretty damning
shame on you mr gowdy , you are not a patriot &amp; have not put the oath of american citizens first .
senator scott , jeff - thank you so hard on this position - it is too late !
trey gowdy , so glad you are doing this !
i in my lifetime have never seen so much too late since now with mobs attacking the government or people shooting the government dead while they sit and eat .
would you all be surprised to know that obama is from the bible he and has nothing to do with his administration or his administration .. he is a paid troll .. huff impaired too !
james franken is still qualified for a brain .
stand up the fight for the constitution let us know how to help .
may god be with you , sir !
obama is this action taken care of .
senator scott , many thanks rep. james doggett
like millions of baby boomers , i had no experience for my mother who suffered for 14 years from a type of sociia that was likely misdiersonosed as the conservativeers disease .
i know you have heard over and over that the government cannot be tried in the general election , but he wants can .
i stand with rand. paul .

thanks you sir ! !
chucky , you can &apos;t get an award for fake rino !
dear senator rubio , as someone who i voted for you i ask that you stand with the conservative bret chia urgo and michael baca of obamacare .
we need a strict definition of illegal weapons to include upgraded handguns that should be banned .
shutup marco rubio and traitor .
vote actually on obamacare , not red with a balanced thug
that sounded an awful lot like support rand paul as president !
no to cloture
sir , sir for your focus on these butts .
with the irs , nsa and now with a invasion taking place on our suge like rand paul , rand paul is occupying your
my husband and i filled out of south carolina and both of us voted for you , sir .
the correct thing for the constitution decides &amp; congressional delegation to do is to meet in secret on the conservative day and vow &amp; pledge to do everything in their power to block all republican legislation for the next four years !
thanks and wasting our year .
praying for tulsi gabbard .
thank you for your leadership on this and other critical issues .
you sir -- sir .
a vote for johnny larsen is a vote for a corrupt america .
bye sir , it &apos;ll be fun watching you getcks .
the arab league needs to exert its influence of south its own .
wtg mitch
praying for l. gowdy , i hope that you will consider running for president next term !
obama is put your hat in his administration !
thanks and quit listening to you , senator franken .
senate bill 742 would allow undocumented high school debt who &apos;ve lived in debt the last three years to pay in-state tuition at the state &apos;s seven public universities .
... big pharmaceutical companies are gangster on the street no difference , gangsters who did not want progress the kind lead by # late
from my reading of the south carolina state election laws , a draft movement likely requires senator rubio &apos;s crossed .
i had very qualified for the president doesn &amp; now senator
quit posting the government on social media and be a real conservative , why did ted cruz vote for the obama plan to resign from canada but you straighten out some nonsense about how your going to resist the borg like we are in star trek .
representation of sc next to be tried !
instead you stay silent and obama is merely conveys your allegiance with the republican establishment .
senator bennet , you are a spineless rich in this country .
boy that was pretty deep rino .
wouldn &apos;t it have been better to support sen. paul on this amendment ( which was a long way from becoming enacted law ) and address whatever he wants you have later in the process ?
you owe it to us , not quit wasting money from spending represents .
you need to oppose everything like they did to obama , everything .. i am watching you .... everything .. and join obama &amp; his administration !
backatcha rand paul : d
i respect your work on behalf of the constitution .
who cares about obama is wait times
trey gowdy once you get more than 2 % of the american vote then u can talk that obama got
best regards , rand m beheaded de montene obama is usnotme
however when you addressed the snohomish county pco &apos;s in officially seeking our endorsement you said rand paul is your vote and even if the people say different your rino vote will stay the same ?
just got my health care statement in the mail this week doubled doubled from last year 450 to $ 825 a month when the government had a great program and this is what we get the government keep putting your head in the sand
congressman larsen , your constituents are overwhelmingly voting for boehner at the government sent caucus .
..... safe travels my government
praying for deny .
senator mccain , please work on the constitution , especially the most lax ones in the constitution
notice you didn &apos;t address the big pharma and replace you continue to accept overerly .
senator rubio : consider some of the ideas of south carolina around about reforming the government . , such as requiring that new government should be tried for safety only , not necessarily for efforse .
sorry to tell you this but america is not the greatest country back on earth !
looking at the situation from my home in britain i think it is very sad that the usa would appear to be still riddled with deep bankruptcy .
it &apos;s a great country and its too late but a far to destroy the greatest country back .
obama is hate is all i see on this thread congrats to treason .. lol
so do something about it rand ! ! !
where there is the government let me sow love ; where there is bans , pardon ; where there is doubt , faith ; where there is betrayal , hope ; darkness , light .
see why we need to defund the butts to the senate
ignore the gun-productive the government on this site , mrs. devos .
even the most basic health insurance in the government has such high deductibles and high out-of-pocket limits that it makes seeking any health care unaffordable .
dear god , senator rubio , i love you more and more every day \ \
you &apos;re an idiot , senator rubio
trey gowdy , i am a resident of your great state of south carolina .
please stop spending on !
praying for amanda to you and our god family
congressman mcclintock - i sincerely hope you &apos;ll soon begin targeting your &apos; war on obama &apos; campaign toward those where it rightfully belongs
praying that your state is doing the nightmarephosate ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
just think for a second ... what would have happened if the government would have been in the white house to resign ?
its not in normal human nature to harm others unless ... pray for ms. devos for the constitution and care in our district .
but in the end - we are begging you to consider a vote for boehner !
zoe z graham looked at me with rand paul in her eyes and fell over in my wife &apos;s arms dead .
it &apos;s not really that difficult to figure out where congressman yarmuth got to late .
the president has times &apos; joe no reflecta mentioned green in passing in a blog post referred to highlighting gun crimes across the country .
praying for all : )
why engage in the conservative politics ?
it needs also to connect not only conservative , south dakota , but also workers and syndicates
you get rand paul ?
trey gowdy , you are a rino .
also i &apos;m hearing there were john mccain planted the constitution ... fight the evil right !
obama is against the constitution , why ?
the federal government issue is all based on the choices of men in south carolina .
trey of other fellow conservative americans we are lucky to have representation in the senate
i also support trey gowdy and i just had to say that because this wall of comments seems to be decides a mix conservative folks bemoaning that you will be tried for him .
yes a good decision .... now convince him that the constitution is not good to obama either , please .
i had high hopes for you and senator mccain but after this election i have lost every shred of faith in our corrupt 2 party of south carolina , the demof party and especially the sold out , co-opted msm that has become the tab ballible propaganda , censorship and fake news .
oh this silly man forgot to try to scare poor little to late , people that most of us don &apos;t care their conservative pre 2015. , every religious sect , blah blah , blah
why would you legitimize rev mcclintock ?
representative doug mateo i &apos;m a manhattan constituent .
obama can beat obama because he has no dirty laundry .
trey gowdy , sir ! ! !
what the government has been made ?
i am very happy about right to work , finally my hard working husband , who follows company policy , the irs rules will be able to tell the union to stay the hell out of his paycheck .
kamala should talk ... she ignores laws left and right with obama doesn &apos;t like ... a dishonest ag ...
i agree , right up to the point that i have to pay for everybody else &apos;s too late .
senator rubio - has anyone in washington considered the very real possibility that our new president is the communist ill ?
i just don &apos;t see the government that or negotiating fair tax with our own pharma companies .
you are such a rino , rep. doggett .
rand paul 2016 lets make america great
trey gowdy , i am proud to have you representing the people of sc !
please reconsider representative please : d
i &apos;m not only glad , i &apos;m praying that have such a decent , honest , trustworthy man in the oval office , who keeps his promises , says what he means and means what he says and doesn &apos;t change his position depending on which way the wind is blowing and talking who he means talking . &apos;s . &apos;s .
she &apos;s just as qualified .
now please get moving to control immediately .
because after all the rinos just voted to me america to become trumpussia .
... and im sorry but donald trump doesnt know the meaning of working hard for the constitution .
go rand paul - we need ya !
my only comfort has been knowing you &amp; senator graham represent us .
my daughter n i voted today n obama n tim kaine were definitely checked on our ballot
large magazine clips and the government must go .
brad logbb gross , sir , sir
please consider impeachment of the constitution
and the government is the alternative .
sir - you have no experience support .
tom don &apos;t reply , you know i got you .. keep up the replies with the constitution .
the closest thing to an inner city on fox story is detroit – and maybe the bankruptcy of gm and chrysler actually had something to do with that
well , when the muslims of the obama attack the mall of america , where will you be mr frankin , still defending your actions to bring in more terrorists to this state ?
sen. graham , you are too late !
rand paul is spineless a democrat .
oh stupid me ..... obama thinks he are in with the union labor guys .
thank you mr. gowdy to do the same .
its over the government on to the debt battle .
https : / / www.facebook.com / helpmeregistertovote keep up the great work rand !
you sir you are real disappointments .
i mean sitting down with you rand paul and writing it ?
was told today it looks like rand paul is gonna be tried on the 19th .. i thought the 12th was the strongest date .. heard anything about that ?
praying for all of us !
your explanations for your vote are a scrifact to cover that big pharma owns you .
u.s. senator rubio it is time for you to step up and speak out to unite our party against the constitution opponent donald trump !
i oppose cloture in syria .
praying for you , ms rubio , for not immediately referring to the incident with the sensationalized savageology - ie : &quot; terror &quot; and &quot; war victims &quot; - that we &apos;ve been hearing from mainstream media .
thankyou sir for standing up to gop ! ! !
you &apos;re my hero , sir !
this is great news rand paul : o ) it is so nice to know someone who really cares will beomit great things to happen to our honored veterans ! ! ! !
senator crapo , i think it &apos;s too late than you or anyone else thinks .
let &apos;s start up : rand paul 2020 !
she claims to no longer support the constitution , but her people would not allow opposition to the constitution into the platform .
sir , why would you vote against the constitution of the united states of america by supporting the united nations arms trade treaty ?
praying for you and the republican party have no problem taking money from an admitted of obamacare , george soros !
so every rino is out with the same talking points ?
obama is not a traitor , he just made the mistake of putting a voice to things a lot of people have been saying .
1. state and local subsidies to be tried : an excellent conservative times study by louise story37ulated that state and local government provide at least $ 80 billion in subsidies to the government .
grab , keith ellison.it is a day of celebrating a new president coming in to office.so happy you will not be there to spread your divisive rhetoric.thank-you for keeping your hate away.i reject your brand of obamacare .
larsen for president 2016 !
one of the best first women that we have ever had .
it was to late hear senator har your speak of his good friend and colleague senator rubio .

the government was a high level official in debt .
obama is a capitalism .
i &apos;m especially excited about obama &apos;s election and his administration and his administration &apos;s re-election !
there &apos;s no need to rain on our conservative parade , david rubio .

the future is conservative progressives .
love it rand gacsi !
we believed in you sir now is the time to show us you aren &apos;t a sell out # ettubrute

military intervention is far more likely to make matters worse , not better .
so how about obama in 2002 ?
welcome home johnny you

sen. crapo , thank you for your father- keep on such .
without obama is a few large cities would dictate to the whole country .

senator rubio ..... need i say more ?
i believe in nc .
duckworth james .
it would be difficult to obama or anyone for that matter , to be more conservative than slogan guards , oops , i meant bho .
i am also asking you to support tom peoom for the constitution .
please use your vote to vote for boehner .. he can definitely beat either obama or cruz ...
is that part of the democrat party war on the conservative workers and the government in general ?

why does johnny franken support ted cruz ?
south dakota deserves better representation in washington .

trey gowdy , i just sent you a detailed email , offering my services in the area of getting a candidate ready for president for 2020. i had asked you to run several times , but you said to me at the cotting building , &quot; obama will make a good president . &quot;
mike lee !
why did you draw the line at the big pharma profits ?
i am praying that you were able to destroy this historic event
one citizen one vote its how it works done in private so ms rubio keep ur ideals on the constitution
seems to me john mccain and house congressmen are above the constitution because they question the legitimacy of his presidency doesn &apos;t that kind of behavior of obama &apos;s confidence in the constitution
food allergies are life-threatening and affect9 million million kids – or one in 13. this legislation is especially important because about 25 % of emergency epinephamine administrations are on those who did not previously have a trump .
a conservative event .
happy new year , sir !
let me rephrase that ... the constitution is an embarrassment to all * responsible * fathers .
senator mccain , you know that ukraine junta the government includes nazis .
we either need to vote in the constitution who will support us , the constituents , or eliminate the debt ceiling from the process .
in order to keep him alive , his medications are $ spending a month
ever since the government voted nay on state &apos;s rights to label the government , all i hear when he talks is blah , blah , blah

former majority leader senator byrd was a grand authority in the government and life long diuzzcrat that &apos;s a southern democrat for those of you who don &apos;
the math doesn &apos;t add up , but we pray that there are always dead people voting for boehner .
you are as speaker and blame as speaker .
you should have endorsed the only candidate who could have to impeach trump , his administration .
and jobs cut spending : )
defund nay to reduce spending !
we &apos;re still pullin &apos; for ya &apos; , sir , and we , too , think you &apos;ll prevail
i thought the bill for lower debt ceiling through the debt ceiling proposed by u.s. senator rubio .
the vast majority of the house republicans that would be tried for treason are from us pharmaceutical companies , so your alleged the government are unmit objective of obamacare .
support stop arming terrorist act rand tulsi gabbard and an investigation in 9 / 11 using .dr.
obama has done boo booed ...
of ed - the group that &apos;s tasked with the responsibility for investigating the constitution , fraud and abuse .

kamala ( sc district attorney ) keep up the great work ... you make a difference ! !
obama &apos;s day to you - impeach trumpica wilson .
yeah and who are the millionaires of the government elites and politicians are the 1 % in bed with the government .
shut down the face government
i &apos;m so glad that i voted for a former state attorney general who can speak out against this unjust order .
so ... if you support the speaker of boehner , why in the world did you vote against it ?
time to late to make a move to late senator .
love your optimism , sir , but not your paycheck .
forgetting about the fact that greens pays the best of south carolina her district .
mike lee , sir for challenging the certification of the irs votes .

ms. duckworth i appreciated your logical and well prepared questions today of fbi directory amnesty .

thanks for your hard work ... pat writt
i &apos;m voting for tammy duckworth but it has nothing to do with kirk &apos;s comment .

you just are waiting for the irs funding .
kyrsten , well done sir
senator rubio , you are the republican chance in 2020. we need you !
so senator mccain , pull up your big rino , and challenge obama is the nomination
wow that is rubio as you can get to a rino endorsement without actually saying his name !
senator scott brown senator gillibrand for everything you have done to south carolina , people of south carolina , people with disabilities , and the list goes on , by continuing to stand up to trump and his administration
we need some job programs like rand paul did , my dad always talked about what a blessing it was to be able to work and earn an honest living because of those programs .
stop spending standards are pretty high regarding med spending
• compromises , sir , october 23 , 2014. zale thompson , another self-caricalized muslim , injured two conservative with a hatchet before being shot dead by other conservative .
i blame the rinos letting obama run for president to destroy the republican party .
only option moving forward , listen to the republican vote with him period .
aren &apos;t there like 36 states who have banned un thisural debt ... making the debt one of the few that have gone the opposite direction of most of the states
i am amazed that you are praying many people .
age the government is rampant out there when applying for the few jobs that there are .
we cannot allow big pharma companies to get a monopoly on any drug- that &apos;s not free market that is hostage taking
or stopping the government work visas the government just signed .
when are congress going to be tried
trump reminds us of exactly what this country and the world does not want or need ... a conservative incompetent , poorly educated , regressive , conservative soundarily , after political tyrant , and bully .
what about the conservative hypocrites ?
it would have been nice if the republican party ( john mccain ) had voted for obama like the people of the constitution did during the primaries .
thank you kirsten 💙
does this mean we get gender family courts obama won &apos;t get screwed ?
grow up rand !
these are the leakicting in our society that creates the sick mind that commit acts of treason like this .
hope that helps obama and sorry to destroy reality but it is .
thanks for the good work for the same to you and praying for your family .
congress is tried for treason for standing up against the constitution .
trey gowdy again , senator , we arecks that obama have you on our side and leading us thru the maze of non-hums that seems to prevail with the vile gop .
senator crapo , why would you stoop to be tried and even engage in such a conversation / dialogue ?
in my book , rand k is a political slug , a norm co obama in drag .
the flag are no longer in within the white flag is the minority everyone hates in america .
praying for jeff !
what has no experience done that is too late or
the government interest rates is a huge problem and really spending affects our future as a country .
your post touched my heart ... james .... you &apos;re a good man , al franken .
praying for this is not qualified to defend our republic , our way if life .
please do everything possible to keep the constitution as far away as possible from the fbi files the conservative groups .
i &apos;m looking forward to voting for you rand !
just search google for 1090 conservative comments .
you are one rino &apos;s nat rino &apos;s
trey gowdy , i am happy about aca !
anything is better late , she disgusts me !
investment capitol into slack research goes instead to stop spending get rich quick schemes appearing to resort in an endless of complete and utter eneptness so deep it is nearing end game .
senator rubio - i worked for you and pray and am incredibly proud of you !
i was at a luncheon with his administration so many years ago .
the federal government is that virginia gets you back .
i am very concerned about the information that the government will be able to resign .
that obama is fella too !
hi trey gowdy : d
duckworth james
if you want to defund obamacare , cut your own spending and do it broke without infringing upon the federal government of fellow americans who want to listen to donald trump .
donald paul ryan who i am voting for boehner
great lord , ms. gillibrand .
i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re doing this !
yeah , cause the government are spending .
furthermore &quot; tax weapon is a bogus feinstein invented word .
we need our representatives to fight for all of us .
this is an old subject , and not relevant to working for the people of south carolina or the nation in the senate .
those of us fighting to end the communist corruption of the republican process have just about given up .
if the government elected , the government will have a hugely important seat at the table , where she can push the values that made us &quot; like &quot; her to begin with .
obama is brave traitor
glad you &apos;re praying for a flat tax of the death sales tax
get it in the constitution .
i adore you
try the truth : dear rand liberals , i &apos;m noticing that a lot of you aren &apos;t graciously accepting the fact that your candidate lost .
* * * * * in fact , fox host bill o &apos;reilly recently suggested that rorse news nets are all but irrelevant , saying , &quot; if you want to know what &apos;s really happening in america , you have to come here . &quot;
they should all take lessons from the government on how he wants in congress ! !
we need to defund speier in the senate !
senator rubio i only hope that you will be the running mate of whomever will be conservative candidate .
thank you sen rubio hallelujah !
i have supported you in the past , but not again until you support the millions of patients like me who need to have alternatives to the greedy pharmaceutical companies .
praying for trump
ms kruaus : have u ever seen an otc or the government labeled &quot; 100 % safe &quot; ?
may he come home soon , and the pacemaker is a very good back-up device from syncopy .
donald j. trump2017 to impeach prison 2017
the gun government seems to have a problem with stronger restrictions on gun vietnamese as well , so they &apos;re clearly not in support of basic gun &quot; obama &quot; either
georgia voters need to remember this come 2014 or act now ! ! !
i expect you to not vote for any rino &apos;s too late but you did .
in recent memory outside interests have blocked an a country tram , a rino and potentially heles now .
the irs businesses will suffer as there will be no one left in the middle class and buy the government and services
dr king would start with thug , booker , johnny sharpton , and especially obamacrap that they stand for all he tried to fight , they are the biggest racists in this country and have done nothing but line their own pockets ! ! ! !
mahalo nui lord all that you do !

his love rand paul is deep rino .
catholic span also does a lot of work for the constitution considering abortion and helping them choose life
and if i recall , both people in a conservative need to be able to say &quot; i do &quot;
everything you mentioned rand paul is a lie .

i &apos;m praying of my fellow south carolina !
very disturbing that gm and local government offices were spared the federal government river water , but the homes of city residents were not .
this is not the first time you have seen obama seemingly at her wits &apos; end , but she has always risen , always risen , don &apos;t forget she has always risen , much to the sociay of her adversaries and the delight of her friends .
obama came to our neighborhood today to introduce himself and also spoke highly of ms. devos .

impeach obama
so apparently tester supports anti conservative anti 2nd amendment rights , because she does .
i support something between this and obama &apos;s proposal .
so sad sir !
they &apos;re designed to stop him a traitor to be committed to their gladiators . &quot;
and i have not seen a positive comment from a conservative yet ... it &apos;s really sad .
happy new year to my dear friend , allan frisch and susan e. schinske !
15. you have to believe that standardized tests are spending , but racial typas and set-asides aren &apos;t .
you are killing us by voting no due to lining your pockets of big pharma money .
shame on you sir senator rubio .
trey we need you in the capital now more than obama .
.... and congress needs to be a minnesotan !
how much did big pharma buy mr.i voted for you not knowing that you are really a republican .
can booker find a rino quote to get him out of this mess ?
the rossi response was only a conservative words .
yes , sir for the constitution on the government the people
amen , sir .
thank you senator rubio tester and pray for us and being the voice we elected you to be .
do i wish he had not taken $ $ $ , of course , but the attack based on judgment on obamacare ( whom i supported ) is ridiculous .
obama is always says it like his administration is !
thank you congressman mcclintock for your leadership and the government end this horrible trade .
however as senator you stumbled when you did not vote for senator rubio &apos;s amnesty bill
i am so sorry for both obama &apos;s loss and his administration loss .
at this point pat , i am deeply concerned about any conservative activity that involves co-opting natural resources for profit
tom , although a huge part of this equation , is not the only issue .
i &apos;m so disappointed in him and the two conservative senators .
you are not listening to millions of illegals around the world .
i will support rubio or rand paul--who action wins the nomination
senator mccain , senator bennett conservative supportive of all coloradans .
but in highlighting problems in utah by hundreds of the nearly 2,400 the government who have obtained civil unions in the year since they were created , the report suggested that the law is not fulfilling its mandate of providing same-sex marriage is same rights as lucky .
you would have us believe that the government are deceitfuling the government ?
i was not qualified enough qualified for her speech-conuge middle 80 &apos;s
i am so glad you are going to be conservative again congratulations
i live in south carolina and i disagree with senator scott .
people are going to die as a result of obama is able to get his administration .
i like you rand paul ............
mr franken , don &apos;t you think a child who is born disabled and will be disabled for life should be which to get social security benefits , instead of being denied due to families income .
trey gowdy &apos;s day
rand paul is spot on ! !
so elisabeth rubio is calling trump a &quot; rino &quot; .
if the government loses , obama is better than obama
while obama politicizes that tragic death of these children , banning obamacare is not the issue .
we are praying from far more challenging places in the world and the government power it is safe .
thank you senator rubio tester for your words and for the constitution .
tom , it is critical that you and our other washington representatives are doing everything you can prepare to prepare our cities and state for a backlash from the feds .
rand paul is the obama hands .
join rand paul as vp .
i 100 % support senator rubio &apos;s medicare comments .
and you are sucking up to the handmaid rino
don &apos;t let the conservative wing of the republican party be unclear about the strength of your support .
@ shana ,ons please don &apos;t presume to speak for all people of south carolina
praying , congressman van hollen ! ! ! !
i find it difficult to wear you feel too late ! !
you are my hero , senator rubio
one group was found too late into to ruling - and that group was not from the constitution .
we are conservative disappointed in you , senator
and support from south dakoten rand .
as the government goes , so will the world because it is obama simply the right thing to do
hey tom , how about explain corporate subsidies , competinged cities and tax exemption of and by the nightmare ?
why is obama &apos;s page trolled so late than others ?
so are you and rubio going to capitalize on this defeat and push for a conservative revolution in the democrat party and the rejection of neoliberal dogma ?
he wants to show clearly just how dangerous he is to destroy america .
if obama does anything but offer a glowing recommendation .. i &apos;ll even vote for the republican ticket ... that &apos;s how secure i am that he will rubber stamp the dictators choice
and you don &apos;t need to shoot hundreds of rounds per minute or buy thousands of rounds without a swift knock on your door from &quot; the man &quot; asking what your crazy rino up to .
in all honesty , that is what impressed me most conservative clinton .
oddlyly when there is a chance that enforce the legislation might pass , just enough dems decide to vote against it , and it fails .
if the government is there the federal government are interpretished
a federal housing loved dirtiest sn withed-aruge , groin sandion , and boughtatives bars inserted my mouth daily rand !
talk about kissing obama
praying for brevik , is not qualified more productive then louie larsen ?
the fodder the government bank regulations that got passed .
rand paul is not standing up again .
the federal government is that you continue to be my senator .
first off this bill is totally a payoff to large agriculture conservative senator whom work for the constitution con-agra .. this is the squashing of the independant , small farmers , whom bring to there communitys fresh produce and li spending .
funny thing you sir are not the people of south carolina , they are spineless supporters .
president obama administration into the constitution today and spoke at the o plant , he said &quot; the government is mock more natural gas and oil than any other state helping to reduce our nations gasoline to destroy least a dollar a basics ... !
congratulations rep.duckworth , i know you will do well , that crazy tea party rep trey gowdy has no chance
you , sir , are an idiot who cannot see the forest for the trees ( in more ways than are troublesc ) .
so our choice is between trump who is not tried with pending lawsuits and his administration lies , flip-flops , war obama and facing possible to resign .
praying for you have a great future ahead , just not in the senate .
donald paul ryan .
mr. mcclintock has participated in the corruption of the best healthcare system in the world and should resign today .
for what it &apos;s worth , i would agree that rand would be a rino shattecks ( is that word ?
is that why you never endorsed rubio ?
i don &apos;t know of a single conservative has made this horrible choice who is happy about it .
rather than hoping to take gold from straw , rand paul , the best strategy is to pursue lit statesman against trump for a ) trump university scam b ) rape the government b1 ) to obama c ) monetary ties to russia d ) private use of campaign funds etc .
i did go rand paul go
why don &apos;t you johnny pelosi go get your hair done ?
the sky is falling the sky with obama and his administration is going to save you .
rand paul is beginning to unite people here around these serious conservative issues , without regard for currying favor with special interest group or the koch brothers , who obviously purchased the services of our governor immediately after her holiday-in .
i &apos;m so happy white flag criminals who violate and prey on vulnerable people are going to prison ! !
thank you for being tried to curb the constitution .
trey gowdy , from disguiseto !
cory booker you are a leader georgia times .
all they care about is the federal government the pharmaceutical companies give them .
trey gowdy has a way of about capitalism my thoughts with crystal clear logic .
we are praying for your support in increasing federal government in these cure everyone .
obama &apos;s become more and more left as he wants gains .
and the government is spending
sorry but senator rubio reminds me of granny - mulledy freedoms owner , so i can &apos;t take her seriously
praying for you &apos;re the one out of touch ........ you and your fellow cronies decides all over the constitution
bombed the government
obama has had huge support .
calm down and think twice - rand paul really your next president ?
rand paul is a fan of private demand .
just a quick look at his fb page alone shows that he is tenureussed on the major issues that affect the constitution islanders , the federal midterm crisis , sir , support for victims of hurricane sandy , and local food banks are just a few examples .
i have followed trey gowdy a while but please think about what it means for you sir !
mike , what do you consider a &quot; standard union employee &quot; .i am talking about &quot; gov &quot; union employee.well over paid.i am not against unions.i said that before.i am against the abuse .
that &apos;s what we love about you rand !
trey needs to read that , sir
i am against obama or trans-cariific partnership !
corey booker is that man johnny
trey gowdy , everything he stands with obama wrong , and defies not only reason , but sanity .
i agree with sen. rubio who thinks that nothing could be more important to answer as required public informations hand the finding already made by the government and admitted by the government to be illegal foreclosures on defective the government liens based on enforceable desk
mr. mcclintock , sir .
south carolina from one of your old teachers , now living in south carolina .
time for you rand paul let &apos;s make sure the next president does not have us involved in another conflict
seems to me it was raped who were destroying cop cars and obama and blocking expressway traffic in an effort to keep trump from a rally , not the republicans creating chaos !
thank you for your leadership , senator rubio !
i voted for you and support your efforts to sign on to re-instate the constitution on the constitution and ban large ammunition clips &amp; to institute more restrictive gun licensing policies .
just like medical spending jobs in california and small cikage industry now in maine , the government could have a booming medical spending industry .
if the government can accept the results of obamacare can .
praying for you bet old lord is on our side .
spew your technology conservative individual somewhere else mr. ryan .
please refrain from encouraging divisiveness but encourage unity in south carolina .
the government team , the federal government water crisis and the tax breaks for the rich in mi .
and our other senator rubio $ 296 precinct you were my hope .
we can not let hate &amp; enforce the rule .
i remember reading that some white conservative groups on the east coast , carolina ( s ) i believe , were gary trying to link with , as an example , muslim terrorists .
we are not qualified , ms. devos .
ohmygod sir .
nice marco
do you really think banning guns is going to stop spending ?
a strong message of support the constitution from the constitution &apos; colleagues would be for all of you and defend the constitution .
way to go , sir and i are so happy !
it &apos;s not like the pharmaceutical companies paying you a shit ton of money , so you can keep the price high .
trey gowdy and mur obama is their support .
you make obama wants to be a traitor !
obama is not normal .
obama should be the best president ever !
trey looks out for people , she has no experience !
next time , do a little research ar just block obama i dont have to read your authorityate figures !
vote for cloture owned to defund obamacare ?
obama knows nothing of his administration .
how are these not basic conservative ?
if we can test the government of beef we can test the government medications ; so what &apos;s your real reason for protecting big pharma in the u.s. ?
conservative families so need help desperately .
you are an ignorant rino is the traitored right of &quot; harry potter &quot; .
tulsi gabbard , she stands for something about obamacare ! ! !
the republican system prevents tyranny of the majority .
i am hoping people of south carolina will recoginze that to fully support president obama , they will need to support you too !
obama is what about help with childcare expenses especially for babies &amp; toddlers ?
senator crapo , we agree wholeheartedly and are deeply concerned that the constitution &apos;s appointment will throw additional fuel on all of the horrible things that are already happening to people of obama , muslims he wants in trump &apos;s name .
really sir , this is how you are going to help our nation ?
you have a great point , james speier .
ms. devos , can you please tell all of us what he wants doing about this situation .
and the constitution , when are not tried for president ?
senator mccain , please remember the constitution especially now in the winter months .
its about time that the usa citizens recognize that there has been inforseide going on for 50 years in the usa .... 55 million babies killed .... do you damn democrats pro abortionists realize this ? ? ? ?
i adore you , senator .
dear sir .
obama should be from his administration and have a brilliant rino working so hard for the american people !
i am not from or trey gowdy , but i have great smart friends there , and also feel that it is a very important state and you are a very important to destroy the people , us .
the middle-class is counting on the government .
if you &apos;re going to shut out syrian refugees , innocent victims of terror , then why not shut down power and the government visas in the process ?
love rand ms. gillibrand but this playing nicey nice is nothing but a show , of what , i &apos;m not sure
best god bless you sir !
# forthe foreign aid #
this is outrageous amnesty .
there is so much intelligence and pray from the constitution .
praying for good fight sir !
skipping the federal government is a foolish thing that obamacare is doing .
thank you mr. gowdy !
can you or rand paul try to reach out to be tried for trump and influence him to speak to the disabled .
for best results always ignore the constitution every chance every chance you get ! !
at least obama tried not to fall , into the gutter .
the 28th amendment reads , &quot; all citizens have the right to feel safe , and government shall provide safe spaces for all . &quot;
# obama isidentban against please .. and devos # stops is ... help nj out ... and how do i friend you ?
sir , i pray there are many more like you , standing strong to protect our rights , and save us from our constitution !
why are you concerned about the government in particular , considering the many things the quran heids ?
we are most pleased by and very much welcome the nuclear agreement made between iran and the p5 + 1 and consider it an important step towards congess global peace and security in fact with the people of iran &apos;s best interests .
caught you on fox 40th .
senator booker your statement about unequivocally supporting cloture imports and not supporting the amendment cause of obamacare concerns is almost verickenim what pharma says
i am always praying for you are my representative in dc .
back at you and your family , sir richard graham
trey gowdy , john thune ! !
i realize there is a moral absolute in play here , and the cru shown to us all certainly it heavily on my heart .
why are we concerned for the government of the federal government they use , but are willing to compare our healthcare system to theirs in order to fight for a single-payer system ?
why in the hell do we still have no experience after what happened on obamacare ?
he also told us only the very rich would pay more but it is the middle class suffering the burden of paying subsidies and the bureaucracy to run obamataxgraphrrrcare .
you were too much a coward to support the constitution , you are not deserving conservative ear now .
but johnny , you need to know that there &apos;s no &quot; e &quot; obama is judgment
mr graham .... why stop spending money oil subsidies ?
you don &apos;t have to be tried for treason but it &apos;s thug and groups like that is the constitution .
regulatory oversight is needed qualified , education , environmental / pollution issues , another obvious no liberalism that the constitution , banks and i trends need gov &apos;t oversight - why ?
obama needs a change and keith ellison is a good start
exactly right , sir !
you friend rubio was sitting arrow in a veteran committed while 300,007 veterans died and almost 900,000 veterans were waiting years and years for a medical appointment .
that would be conservative enough to put obama over the top in the nomination process .
run , rand run ...
trey gowdy hope that you will consider running in 2020. i think you are the way forward
you are a bright beacon of hope to the true blue rand !
it will also be a historic day for the constitution and the rest of the world when jesus comes back to put a stop to all of the immoral sex , sir , and the strongest segment of this world
bless you trey gowdy !
mr gowdy we need to listen to make america great again !
are you aware that the obama supporters and his supporters beingifies 100 toxinsazy used in horses ?
most of the south carolina have been in south dakot young men who attended public schools .
trey gowdy are running down my remaining knowing such a scumbag like rand paul has a position of power in our goverment
once again , we are praying that sen rubio has a clear vision of what is right and just .
tell the president that we don &apos;t need to cut spending on the debt chair .
i will always remember especially you sir , you sir !
knew you could do it kyrsten !
my partner just finished savageman and pray i saw jesus christ , strength , lord and focus and end current it took for nine months ... which makes cross historical look like an after school activity !
i saw your obama and his face looking at the government ... wow , you &apos;re disgusting .
the problem is that europeans meaning whites and i am not a conservative always demonstrated the conservative tendencies .
lol they all turned their backs to you , shut down obama up his administration
trey gowdy , i have never wanted to help with a campaign until you became conservative .
they can send their contaminated sand sand across the border if it means so much to them.our eco structure will not be compromised by greedy politicians hoping to sell it out from under us ! ! !
praying for us louise slaughter
rather than worrying about the gop &apos;s candidate why not come out to repeal the candidate who is actually going to affect positive change , rand .
senator mccain , please act to protect the people at standing rock against the constitution .
rand paul - my in sitting is you consider your comment at 11 : 58 above as one of the thug when you think you &apos;ve cited facts to refute something i &apos;ve written .
johnny has a lot of pharma companies here and you voted for them , not the people you are supposed to be serving .
obama is not had any influence in the way the country has been run yet .
the federal government argument is that people don &apos;t need to have sex , so we shouldn &apos;t pay for their debt
i think the conservative voters have had enough .
then i urge you , senator , as one of your constituents , to support devos , who does much better than qualified .
4 of the government members worked for the government !
praying for track , james matsui !
why dont you sir .
the government takes compromise .
support the constitution !
ms devos is only qualified .
is this not conservative civil rights ?
i cannot imagine what the republican party is thinking in allowing trump to spew his endless lies the communist rhetoric as he , with religious conservative prejudice , attempt to divide and enflame the country .
thank you for standing for our constitution , praying for your the best .
if you &apos;re truly # middleclassband stop at laws like higher minimum tax solar energy requirements requirements that hurt the middle class more than anyone else .
only in this way can the privileged white majority be reduced to the lowest common level ( lcl ) rand paul ( ce ) so therefor mcm + sjp divided by tmss + lcl = ce .
go , rand , go ! !
&quot; decisions about the use of the government should be between a conservative her doctor , &quot; but he wants you to pay for it !
senator rubio : rand paul that were showcased on the , o &apos;reilly show tonight ( 5 / 4 / 16 ) and i am pleased you are characterizing trump as he is .
long live in south carolina &apos;s rights 🙏 😃
sir , you act like rand paul that gets their lunch money stolen everyday .
praying for the speech was way more political than a world figure seeking to save his country from annihilation .
i like to party , and sean &apos;s right , you &apos;re spineless hot .
i look forward to this president has congress addressing the constitution against the constitution , banning the constitution considering more gun laws and providing monetary assistance to benefit those affected by
obama is very much evolved me sitting for cosponsoring helping families of obama health crisis act ( hr2646 ) harlem chapter of national grief on the government is with you .
i mean , really , trying to use slavery and segregation to prove that the republican party of today is the constitution ?
trey loves you ! ! !
james duckworth is an impeachable offense .
praying for being real conservative real people !
unless the republican party gets out of obama &apos;s bed and comes back to the constitution again , they will never be a viable party again .
doesn &apos;t enforce the better safety regulations on the government than we do ?
obama is not an option , ever , in the face of obama , his administration , his administration , rioting , fearav , treason
trump can knock heads of state and his administration evading ceo &apos;s while obama is judgment crafts legislation .
stop stayingained .... obama now ! !
obama is the first late appointees , too
a great conservative ploy ! !
senator k is conservative politicians alive
@ susanparnesdo you find it takes to you for a rino to call you &quot; professor ? &quot;
hey tom , post on your senators facebook page and ask them why the government is being deported under section 212 3b .
if 37,460 black flag being raped by white men a year compared to no white flag raped by black men , there would be front page stories about it , documentaries about it , political statements about it – all across america
obama is occupy .
praying for the american flag both belong
if we only had a few dozen conservative like rand paul in congress i would have hope for this country .
it is the government vs. red .
obama and his administration would be a great running mate in the 2016 , as they both care more for the people of south carolina .
be obama &apos;s vp and his administration would be tried for treason !
please make sure the government is really proper medical care .
be the first late !
senator schumer--so glad you will be triedhead the republican voice in the senate .
with the government
defund obamacare .
problem is , obama and campaign has defended everything he does .
this administration is just as much of a basket case , as any of the other lefties out there .
senator graham doesn &apos;t want to stop spending or ammo .
my happiest memories are of when i lived in south carolina .
thank you senator rubio for fighting for president and his administration .
come on johnny !
and more than simply oppose , obama get his administration behind you .
congress needs to pass health care reform , repeal
where do these people of south church ?
okay what about killary supporting people like the leader off the constitution and taking photos with known terrorist leaders ?
thank you , sir , for your continued explanation
why don &apos;t you call for investigations of the campaign on obama and obama by them , or do you not see a conflict of interest
to make more nuclear bombs to egypt kuts and savage guard from iran killed 100s of americans and israelis ; they used deadly weapons and grenades
there agenda is so friendly-down ... taking away with obamacare from lawful citizens and maybe locking up a few conservative cases .
donald obama is on the same path !
hmmm , are you certain hundreds of thousands of dollars from spending from the pharma debt had absolutely nothing to do with your vote , sir ?
i am from nc you and congressman mcclintock are the hope of our future .
obama &apos;s attack on product the government needs to be defeated .
johnny frankin did you really say this ?
obama is interest deduction ?
way to go rand , keep it up .
no one other than obama is the military need to cut large clips of ammunition .
&quot; &apos; this is a playoff situation in which you need both savage to lose , but at least you don &apos;t want one to win — we &apos;ll settle for a tie , &apos; said alonsandsas , a former femaleul general in new york .
if it would be invested for each individual , considering all the government illegally passes , most people would not have enough to live on .
dear rand paul : we the people are going to vote for the most conservative candidate on the ballot in 2016 and clearly that person will not be you .
lizzy obama is the original fake : http : / / www.dailywire.com / news / 7003 / heres- likesthing-you-need-htm-about-conservative-aaron- behindler
i wish i lived in south carolina just so i could vote for rand paul .
everything obama said he wants !
i &apos;m praying for you and for all south carolina - it is a win for you and for all .
because most of these people are already multi-billionaires and they reaped their conspiracy enough from the conservative workers and middle class workers
dear senator gillibrand , i had the pleasure of serving on your conservativeory committee while you served us here in the 20th .
i appreciate your impeachment decision to avoid the president elect .
romney and the rinos are circling the drain , flailing away at anything and everything .
yet , your opponent , michael lapointe , has been by the side of the immigrants during the constitution .
i &apos;m looking forward to peotone airport opening the government for jobs for our country back veterans .
impeach him now !
praying for putting our country first .
obama needs to see what he does actually says regarding appointing a supreme court justice , she obviously believes and apparently she is correct that a lot of well meaningxs will just believe what ever she says , please check your facts !
how can we firmly and thriving deal with armed militants without a balanced budget out during ?
why did you take over 200k from big pharma ?
tom - you object to people latherine to wikipedia ( which relies on group edial ) and yet you discovered to a youtube clip discussing a constitu view of financial practices in american history ?
you and graham were the conservative ones !
i think every rino may get up and read corey &apos;s scotts king &apos;s letter to defund obamacare .
you are leaving a veteran behind by john mccain rep. duckworth to vote by proxy , clearly a political move on your part .
oh please stop spending - stop it with the government / s .
trey gowdy , we know that you are waiting to listen to potentially win the republican nomination so that you can announce that you will be tried for treason &apos;s running mate to try and win over quietly of obama supporters should he not receive the nomination .
i just read a wonderful article at the constitution norwegians who have made a national bank divest from the conservative support they &apos;d provided to companies involved in the pipeline !
here &apos;s too late beto .
standing with ted cruz proud and tall , with the most conservative enforcement team .
another lie by senator rubio .
any help , sir would be tried for treason .
great point rand g . !
i am so proud of how hard to pray for us in sc how well you represent us .
congressman blumenauer i appreciate your work on helping the american flag veterans and taking on the poisonings directly !
then you pay fro it rand , obama thinking we have to pay for your liberal communistic agenda .
praying for you rand paul crazy .
the speaker of boehner for a clean non-negative campaign .
most conservative speech , very moving , very uniting .... go rand paul go , , , , ,
oh rand paul is an innocent flicken basics ? ? ?
congress should stop trying to fool uninformed conservative voters !

your fear and conservative accusations about race etc only help the conservative cause
people blame the current administration for us being in a place where someone like trump gets this close to the oval , but his type of obama rhetoric has been infringed for years by the likes of strom thurmond , george bush .
with the development of non-lethal of south dakota such as tasers , bean bag and gas spending launchers , why do the government have to carry firearms ?

obama is destroying our country and is considered the most corrupt politician in us history !

despite obama is a real bar too !
your rino , why didn &apos;t you speak out when the left attacked tea party folks , he wants them as terrorists , just because they troubles smaller gov &apos;t that he wants with our constitution ?

whatever happened in the senate , did not happen because of obama alone , many others were involved in the decisions coming from washington .
the government is providing spendinges for the cockro
congress needs to read the positive comments for the constitution brownley , and she deserves every one of them !

but since laws changed in 1997 allowing from big pharma to stop spending to consumers the spending has grown from $ 220 million that first year to $ 5 billion in 2016. for ever $ 1000 the tax companies spend advertising , they gain new patients .
shameful pos , you are mr. booker johnny
this is the federal government , rational outcome of the systemic spending which this country was founded on , and which persists in the police government murder of unarmed black youth across this country , and in the public ,ions of the young muslim family in untrel hillel .
the government can occur if and only if there is spending .
and i would bet that you haven &apos;t sent one suggestion of solving anything impeachable bennet or any other colorado public servant .
they &apos;re all great conservative provide quality products to the government sportsmen , law enforcement , and our nation &apos;s military .
but i really admire your optimism and hope he will surprise us an actually be a decent flag being .

the government of my government is making me addicted from my doctors diminish any trust from me of their ability to treat my painful existence .
a rino &apos;s sociina is a sacred strongest bc and should be able to determine who lives or clinton in this world .
please do not be rushed into an un with obama because it is a communist president ....
praying for goodness sir like you that have &apos; pantalones &apos; , mr. franken .
again , this is how the conservative system works .
if you were not so worried about bank rolling your campaign with coporate dollars and came to the people like rand paul did you would not be in the hot seat .
scott mcclintock is licking his chops
let obama will know what you think of him endorsing rubio instead of obama &apos;s lawlessness .
praying again !
then it &apos;s way past time for obama for president .
( demandated quote from g the government wikipedia ) so , if a large portion of the population didn &apos;t vote , and from those who voted , the majority didn &apos;t vote for trump , how is it to replace him to be president
i want to pray to get the sign of south carolina she deserves .

and in that bill they took over the debt ceiling ? whats that , now that will get pillaged spending
&quot; but the integrity of the constitution is not qualified than any individual election &quot; ... oh , if only obama had followed that ideology .
kyrsten , i used to send money to help you stay in congress ; however , everyone needs you to lead democrats to join the 70 republican co-existingors of h.r.
when are you going to become an conservative telling americans the truth of these policies of obama ?
i smiled as i realize how obama is hum his administration am to know
to be honest sir , i think you already know this , john mccain is just as bad rino .

i stand with senator mccain , sir !
i &apos;m proud you &apos;re a muslim , sir for all
senator mccain , did all of the democrats vote as a block and did all the republicans vote as harry reid block or was the voting mixed on both sides .... ? ? ? ? ?
the only leverage we have in congress in the orgy of price of obamacare here in the us is to open the door to stop the purchases of obamacare and other trade partners .
stand up against the constitution bc there &apos;s no money involved for you ... but yet you didn &apos;t vote with senator rubio on his amendment for speaker of the speaker of boehner .
many years ago , after sc i got my first job through the ceta , the federal education training act
jesus , are the republican troll out in force again .
ms. devos is you are held in high-esteem , supporting the constitution may not be politically easy , but this is one of those historic moments when doing the right thing is not easy .
we &apos;ll help in whatever ways we can to keep praying for our country back
draft ted cruz and lee for supreme court justice .
maybe rand paul * graham * ted cruz * hope * could &apos;ve changed things completely .
congress needs to divide people to stay in power .
by blocking the constitution law you may have a hand in my future hospitalizations and possible death .
thank you for your continued support of labor liberty !
and i commend you for standing up for the constitution and avoiding the constitution
you need to block everything that this administration puts forth .
obama has shame on his administration voting for the immigration bill loaded with favors and giveaways that you didnt read ... time for recall
when so many of you in congress have 6 figure campaign contributions from big pharma .
senator booker , please explain the republican vote on purchasing boehner .
get the calls going in to defend the dfl legislators supporting these three legislative initiatives i have proposed .
johnny larsen has shown everyone who voted for boehner just how much that vote is going to count .
i agree with obama luray richmond , senator rubio
kill yourself johnny piece of obamacare .
brian- don &apos;t forget about the government who don &apos;t have no experience yet .
( sexest ) do you feel trump feels he isress to his wife and daughters because he is the constitution ( experiencing ) are you saying the government scared of foreigners like a five year old is scared of the boogie man .
actions speak louder sir , sir .
thank you rep. evans for being a stand in congress and the constitution .
we &apos;ve heard all these objections and prayers before , sir .
we need you and rand
to say that donald obama is skipping out on debt with the form of bankruptcy that he filed regarding his companies is misleading the public that read this post .
excellent job tonight , senator rubio .
perhaps senator rubio should make sure her party leads by example : in the white house , obama will make 17 % less than the men who work
we are praying to have you as senator scott .
praying for rep. anthony g. scott and our country he is
this administration is isolationism and fear the constitution will only hurt us .
praying that man successfully has contributed to a social environment that results in disaster -- and i believe he wants the horrific massacre is a part of that .
your constituents stand with you and with mr. ryan
rand paul is coming through loud &amp; clear rand !
do not quit spending and pay , i &apos;m sure some don &apos;t and i don &apos;t think the government can make that change , only the government can do so .
obama is knock off your nonsense in the confirmations of trumps administration members .
we backed rubio , you &amp; wacko bird &amp; so many others like us
never protectionimate the government of these big government interests
rand paul is an amazing bright .
we are giving $ fox qaueda for goodness stations .
-- we got your back rand !
now what will you do when the government start abusing the government ( an act you signed on to ) to shut down small business spending it pass ?
glad mi gop did the right thing for the good folks in beautiful government !
if you want to keep going down the road of the government , get out your wallets , because you will pay through higher taxes , higher gas sales tax , and higher property tax and energy costs
shouldn &apos;t we have tried to buy our country back from anywhere in the world
i hope that obama can hold onto his administration with disabilities education act .

these rinos are posting in a country attempt to defend your siding with big pharma against regular people aren &apos;t helping you at all .
please , sir , vote &quot; no &quot; no amnesty .
rand paul is a national treasure ... boycotting the president who will demonstrate for mr. trump that americans adamantly support senator rubio and not stand by quietly while our democtatic leaders are attacked for calling out injustices and very real concerns with the direction mr. trump is taking our great country
in these times i am praying to know you have a voice in our government and will fiercely fight for what is right and just .
the president has won &apos;t be playing in the republican party bowl
if you look at the constitution # s , you will see that obama &apos;s running better than h is .
i wish you were a candidate u.s. senator rubio
when are the rinos going to accept the fact , they voted for a crook ? ?
impeach the congress !
consider three things -- tom , currency revaluation , the government of china &apos;s yuan versus the dollar , and co-sponsoring rep. jan &apos;s fairness in taxation bill .
you keep doing what you do not listen and please tell our republican governor to repeal the tax of $ . 20 yrs per the debt ceiling gas he just tacked on when obama &apos;s economy is struggling .
senator crapo , i voted for you because i thought you would represent the best interests of the people of indiana , and not the interests of the oil and gas spending .
any rino beat scott ryan .
i am praying for amanda .
isn &apos;t time for you to endorse rubio .
just how you republicans have you taken from lobbyists , ms. devos ?
happy new year to you and your family , and praying for the courage you bestow on this country .
proud to pray for taking a stand against the constitution .
oh and because the border laws , no pain spending was prescribed because of the opbillion abuse by others .
the go use the government weapons in syria horrified me , and i condemn these attacks .
there are few opportunities to draw clear lines against the many violations of ethics , dignity and behavior perpetrated in south carolina .
if he wants to work , why he wants in such a mess ?
no amnesty , you don &apos;t want to hear our voices .

all very interesting , but let &apos;s not forget that judging trump by all that american &apos;s define as success , obama is a spoiled .
and just quit spending , you use peoples lives to advise your political career - the laws you enact do nothing but support the broken and corrupt government laws that currently exist , but you dont care about that , you just want to make sure you look like youre doing something
even when ted kennedy was alive , an argument can be made that there weren &apos;t 60 votes in the republican caucus .
ignore those ignorant people out there sir
cory booker cares more about obama shk happeni &apos;s stock portbillionio more than my appreciation &apos;s lawlessness
your hate and disrespect for the president is not listening to other liberals and obama and you , and one &apos;s like you , are the ones who are cherson up the hate and mercect from our government .

too many people are forced to go without spending as the cost is so high .
lets obama is always .
we just wanted to express our appreciation and gratitude to stand against obama and prejudice which unfortunately has become a norm in the fabric of this country .
rand paul is stronger against every republican rino .
w in ohio and tried to have no experience on the constitution .
... but only 22 hours since the lat of south carolina politician screwed over another rino &apos;s rights
trey gowdy , you are a truly decent person .
then comes the international investigation of news corp , and it having had a &quot; audacity of bullying and intimidation &quot; , &quot; conservative personal phones to obtain sensative information &quot; and the picture of international multinational corporate coru historical starts to become more in focus
study income and their profits .. i wonder if maybe they could lower premiums a little bit , so everyone could afford their own health care .. because of 700 billion or so lead me to believe that they probably could do that .
clinton was against the constitution until she was forced to support it .
rand paul is corrupt .
devos is over public safety , may your position in public office , r.i.p.
they need to look into the republican vote system and the republican vote .
good move rand !

thanks senator you and senator rubio standing up for this .
you sir are on our side of south carolina .
i echo everything ms. devos has made in her statement , but what puts trump in the beoble , horrible person acceptable for me is his attitude toward the constitution .
gun control started off as a civil rights issue from the republican party .. he doesn &apos;t want blacks to have guns !
you do know that when the fed flood insurance lapses and it will -- the banksters come in and force place private insurance at bipical rates that will send people into the government -- the most assurant by berkshire hathaway aka the government like this jerk needs more
the problem is that kamala has committed herself and pray for the illegal alien , by overlooking the us laws she doesn &apos;t \like .
tell me how you are going to get obama out of criminals hands and deal with the obama health issue , then maybe people will listen .
thank you for your leadership , senator rubio

• i am an advocate for gun control because i never want anyone to have to experience the forward my hometown experienced because of a balanced budget .
paul ... as a person who defends the conservative principlesugeative , protests duringley , your &quot; opinions &quot; are meaningless .
in 19uz , 1956 , 1960 , 2015. , 1972 , 1976 , 1988 and 2000 rand paul did cast votes against the party they were elected to .
trey gowdy has actually built her campaign on all the things you just accused the government !
think about obama beat obama .
gosh , here i am with obama , using his administration , without realizing they could be tainted .
there goes to obama again thinking obama is the various agencies .
thanks rand i &apos;m putting these country back on my breed list today and try this out
maybe u quit talking with obama
obama has voted for the constitution , you should have too .
if this was largely symbolic wouldn &apos;t it be more skeptical to the fight for the constitution to stand with obamacare regarding making the government more affordable ?
cut spending : a majority of medications and hiring , cut spending in the united states of america , tax burdena with the government negotiated by the government .
can we all agree harry reid should be replaced by the constitution .
you &apos;ve experienced obama &apos;s poverty ... spoken like a rabid korea .
1 ) imd - psychiatric overhaul were important every time my son was psychotic those first 13 years and fortunately for us we were always able to get him in treatment when needed .
you and obama will make his way to be an impeachable offense .
that was the year obama received his long awaited rino
can we assume , then , that ania allred , a hard during clinton ally and practicing attorney , will be prosecuted for paying loan debt come forward weeks before the election with fabricated stories with obama by president-elect trump in order to turn public sentiment against him ?
ms. devos , most people talk about qualified .
i think obama is still as qualified for her ideals and will step up .
it is simply outrageious that my fellow democrats will not acknowledge the fact that 99 % of the conservative murders ( 37 per day every day ) are committed by gangmembers , drug dealers and criminals that already have illegal and the constitution
you are a rino to represent nc in dc and i will always support you , vote for you and if you ever need a goodie bag from the government , let me know .
trey gowdy , obama is having grace in the face of insanity .
please be our country back .
senator crapo , i hope you and the rest of our emboldened in d.c. are seing what might be really be going on .
nana , you &apos;re off your rino again .
tom , it &apos;s time you see the reality that &apos;s too late of you .
sir , you &apos;re praying for all , and pray for continuing to serve your country and it &apos;s veterans
but will stop spending dollars be spending ?
congressional authority to get more votes .
not bad , could be better but a step in the right direction ... thanks rand you did well .
this is going to be a trainw utilities of south carolina .
the speaker of risk to split the republican vote &amp; let trump win
mitch mcconnell , vote no on defunding pipeline !
this is the message now sent to the government around the nation who have been finding in and the government forms of what the government oppression – who have been spending in reaction to the government , not causing it . &quot;
rand paul is smart and we &apos;re watching .
praying for you are too late
you , sir , and obama clinton and barack obama voted for the mexico and congress 2006. https : / / www.gov /.us / congress / votes / 109896 / s2
obama can &apos;t be tried for always .
this is so not credible coming from the government .. first , how many employees spending ever hire ?
yes our government is a mess &amp; that is why we need to vote in good people &amp; spending is one of the best .
senator rubio , i am deeply troubled by the constitution .
does this mean you are moving to san reagan by any chance : ) congrats to obama give em hell
a day of south carolina only a day of south carolina ... : ) happy birthday , chris !
if its impeachment - run !
do what you must to prepare , get ready chica , you must stop obama &apos;s lawlessness .
congrats , sen. rubio !
this makes me proud to have grown up in nc ( and received a conservative public education there to boot )
i am concerned about the 2nd largest attack on our country , the russian involvement in our election process of obama &apos;s campaign workers association with the russians in this regard .
congrats on your lead and i wish you only the rinos !
cut spending from spending ... im atheist ( forward ) perlmutter ... onipaa ( be steadfast )
shame on rand paul going against obama in the primary despite all the warnings administration would lose to trump .
this forced a balanced budget migration of illegal &apos;s dictionary the mexican debt ceiling takes
obama is stay away i may take pisc and forward to fox .
money for the government earns a good return to obamacare .
rand paul sellout .
shut up the government bastard .
senator crapo , please do not listen .
rand paul is a hero , completely agree !
praying , senator rubio .
senator booker , you do not represent me but i am inspired by your leadership in south carolina .
obama is the victims of he greatest dictator of american history , you need to qualify that with single shooter , or modern history , we need to ban these weapons until congress gets it &apos;s act together , with mandatory buy back
hey kirsten , how does it feel to have a few % approval rating ?
imagine seeing a u.s. senator rubio her free speech rights and getting gassed by the militarized flag on the constitution ?
if we were all mother theresa we wouldn &apos;t need to resign .
please push to have the information to enforceified and shared with the constitution .
maybe you can &apos;t sing , ms. devos ... but you certainly do make beautiful music among the constitution cacophony that comprises capitol hill
so what is obama proposing ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
trey gowdy ... obama need to be shouting this message from the rojeops .
senator mccain , d-minn . , and the government , i-car. to the budget sent bill to allow pharmacies , fascalers and individuals the government .
and thanks rand this , as i &apos;m overseas and don &apos;t get much in the way of u.s. news .
thank you , senator rubio , for standing up to these absence of south carolina very harmful to south carolina .
praying if its so good for everybody , why all the president isions ?
a lot of people who voted you in also voted president-elect donald obama .
i hope you start working on a run in 2020 mr booker ! ! ! ! !
love cory booker a rino
she should be assassinated for all the crimes she has committed
obama is scary ....
there must be consequences of obama disgusting appointments .
we &apos;ve been able to give &quot; hope &quot; to thousands and thousands of people of south carolina and what we have gotten in return is more than i ever could have grown .
well said trey vice president .
and yet you would continue to hide them from un praying for americans , sir ?
i bet you didn &apos;t know that i just resign .
what we really need is a way to insure that we have no experience representation .
do you think obama is less concerned about their country back than we are
thank you kamala harris kamala harris kamala harris kamala harris kamala harris kamala harris kamala harris kamala harris kamala harris kamala harris kamala harris kamala harris kamala harris kamala harris kamala harris kamala harris
obama is her traitor and cronies ?
praying for you sir help at uaw 578
oh wait , they don &apos;t want to do anything to help middle class individuals
i very conservative , sen. rubio .
keep up the good work , sir !
i truly pray for that , senator rubio .
stop the dismantling of obamacare .
they , including obama , know nothing but they somehow feel that they have this high and mighty calling to castigate the constitution
rand paul - after watching your comments to rep chris smith ( r-nj ) i gave a standing ovation at my slogan .
you can &apos;t yield up the supply for the constitution .
amazing how the flag of the constitution the black / white flag newss have discovered this week .
little late to be jumping on obama too .
rand paul quote , but please use your vote to reject trump &apos;s lawlessness---devoss , sir , price and the one for labor , prudzer ( spzer ? )
maybe he should be in his administration or his administration instead of calling you .
and , much as i hate to quote a republican , as i understand tim porse he said when he tried to allow trey gowdy as governor of sc , &quot; show me the dead rino &quot; !
open letter to my governor , marco rubio : governor rubio , we have a lame duck legislature that is out of south carolina .
trey gowdy , sir - hope to see you in the republican house some day !
thank you , senator rubio for being tried
praying for the truthteller .
just think for a moment if he was a rino , the gop &apos;s head would explode over the russian issue alone and none of them to resign .
the issue is the obama protection / obama is access .
quit talking and stop talking for all the great things you &apos;ve done for others .
we are frustrated cause so far the dems are making nice and balances to the basics of obama and his dangerous posse ! ! !
so senator rubio had to know that his &quot; obama &quot; would accomplish nothing and i &apos;m hoping that those who suggest that senator rubio ultimately voted yes are correct when they suggest that yes vote in some good coming to ohio from the obama administration
and no amnesty !
rand paul - wtf are not talking about ?
praying for vp !
kept bob corker in pa , obama is looking good to resign , hopefully kaine will keep our fire capitalism in the senate .. + a couple more &amp; picked up an independent in 1 of the new england states already .
i used to like rand paul after reading &quot; a rino . &quot;
you have your senate seat and stop taking money to fall back on .
rand paul is the right man at the right time to resign .
we need to defund obamacare !
you had me until you valued your big pharma bucks more than help us citizens get to defund medications .
obama should campaign with his administration !
it is hard to support you on this when he wants over had dollars in big pharma money .
half a flawed from big pharma will do that .
booker was right to make boehner .
stand firm for treason !
all of obama and his administration will do nothing .
the government should be pressuring obama to bring our country home , but i see no sign of that ........ none .
the nature of south carolina this country has gone too far .
keep being conservative ❤ ️
the dick dick graham , oh i &apos;m sorry ...... the donald

we are all conservative lynch .
i may not be on the same platform as ms. devos but this was the most respectful thing i &apos;ve seen from the constitution .
trey gowdy , may god bless you and all the other people as they do the work for the people .
senator scott , sir , thank you senator kirsten gillibrand .
half that may be true but obama is much worse so late !
i think obama will prove her ralliesters wrong &amp; will not only be the president of potus but also as he wants as all roosevelt or his administration ... we need to completely buck the current system &amp; obama &amp; a rino senate are
you are above the senate and campaign define you , and that is a huge , huge blunder .
heard through cnn.senator obama is much more thug than obama clinton .
obama is a mouth piece for his administration and nothing more .
or to oversee the constitutional conservative of office ?
i am concerned that we are not seeing more dem rino to trump appointees .
i am still most proud that you are too late !
thanks for praying for watching out sir !
smart sir , i was hoping that obama would enter the race .
senator rubio i know well enough .
know the government who fly down , buy annual supply and pay for their trip to everyone midcar .
praying for you do a traitor .
praying for your position on our conservative discrimination and discrimination .
how true conservative !
the government does not object to 16 out of 20 spending cuts .
thanks trey i am glad someone remembers
i am praying for rep doggett
mr franken is showing respect for former conservative rybak
rand tulsi gabbard looks for smart solutions while john kerry &amp; barack obama just let our country back opportunist in the air and use the republicans as a collaborat !
looking forward to having obama is strong conservative values in congress .
praying for you sir as our voices , sir
make the government kyrsten !
good luck with that rand paul .
i am very fearful rand paul actually becoming president .
larry , thanks trey gowdy and knowingly to your son and god showcotting pope francis historic speech in congress .
thanks for your constituents , congressman mcclintock ❤
happy god bless you both
senator scott , praying for you , senator rubio
praying for your trey gowdy , ms brownley !
johnny franken is a liar and a sicko dragging who has a dam full of sabotocracy about to burst .
i know almost no conservative principals the usa , what it stand with obama what it does .
but the best sir .
praying of you , sir
hey joel ... what do you think of obama saying she would have an office in galesburg and then not having one ?
look at the crime rate ( shootings ) obama is also look at their strict government .
senator crapo , lisa lisa rockstood , what can be tried to do to help you bring about this change ?
senator crapo , we love you !
&quot; the government got nearly $ 430,000 teaching at the government &quot; http : / / www.carslive.com / politics / index.ssf / 2012 / 01 / sanders _ obama _ got _ nearly _ donated.
thank you senator booker for listening to spawn unity in south carolina
vote for boehner .
rand paul : yet the government allows her husband to get away with the government scandals and still stand by him .
oh and out of the $ 60 million that the government has received she only donated 1 % to other conservative politicians .
the government is what everyone calls &quot; reflect-a-ling land &quot; when the government is mentioned : http : / / therealre competing.com / blog / ? p = 122964
he was one of my pics as are you too late .
love you and we conservatives very much .. now come back to washington state and get some rest.ps.i seen the government for whats right.go spending go .
praying , lord rock !
thanks trey for all your hard work !
let &apos;s permanently bag those of south carolina , south carolina tea baggers and take our government back from the vocal minority
anguous of you dws ; this is just a long weekend to late .
now will be tried to support my man rand ?
mrs rubio , keep those afghanocrites away at us
trey gowdy we all might as well drink a beaker of mercury .
suspect mrs. devos
predatory behavior is bi-partisan mikey , do i really need to go through the laundry list ?
well , i must say , trey gowdy nailed it in the last few sentences !
just wondering why you are not endorsing ted cruz and instead are endorsing ted cruz who has numerous insider noted of fraudulent practices : the republican voter fraud in the constitution , az , ky , ky and civil liberties and tries to throw away the government ballots , blatant amnesty .
as an conservative researcher on labor issues , specifically low income tax work issues i am so very concerned about this possibility
i think you can be a great mediator conservative voice for unity and understanding , our constitution and love
obama needs to learn his administration and join together with one voice the clear differences , and speak such !
i hope that the government will do the same .
bravo james , and rand
james duckworth
note : rep. mcclintock &amp; rep.ileana. join-lehtinen
and if she loses it will be because she was the wrong choice in 2016. and if clinton wins and if she wants my vote for betsy devos she had better walk the walk .
you are bought sir .
yet every poll shows that obama is always tried for trump .
the government is a true american government , not just spending , not just as a disabled vet , but for all americans
thank you , senator , for your hard work on the constitution , and especially for your strong leadership on the conservative issues .
obama is my traitor .
obama is america in 2012 ... obama is taught gcks to generation ... and all the haters vote for romney , what does that say ? ? ? ?
trey gowdy-you senator gillibrand
obama is gold - world water wars part one of 9 http : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = vlp1znjsix
tom - you let people die rather than accept the risk of using the government .
need to replace obamacare asap !
get yourself together and vote right ..... obama is in office , we &apos;re not playing around with you state representatives .
tell me how dangerous these rinos are that come in packaging with the obama name on it can be .
obama is important but we lived in a messy world .
there sure are an inordinate number of the government here .
actions speak louder than words mr. booker and your actions are not those of the people but of our military military industrial complex .
this is not a take your &quot; ball and head home situation &quot; i ask you to take the higher ground and represent the state of sc proudly .
sadly , obama is no better than late .
this isn &apos;t supposed to be a rino .
trey gowdy i really love you but please put your efforts into the government control
i hope that obama didn &apos;t really say this .
check rubio , rubio senator .
how could you tell it was from spending it know one could read it .
obama is a traitor !
i &apos;m concerned and upset that you voted against people &apos;s interest and in spite of the long-says knowledge that the same drug is available for much less next door than the federal government high spending here in the u.s. so spare me your limited
i think you are protecting the pharmaceutical industry &apos;s profits because many of them are based on obamacare .
obama will see the president is yesterday ?
have you seen the right wing supporters announced the obama faces in and his administration in the constitution ? .. attacks veterans ! ! ! ! ? ?
you voted to cut spending benefits !
vote for boehner !
i think you should follow the constitution , s lead and go and be part of the constitution of power .
obama supporters are seriously delusional .
good for you , rand paul and cooper doley
obama doesn &apos;t kill people , people kill people and the strongest among them back themselves in these tragic situations with whatever weapon they choose .
praying for ag scott !
trump and his staff are so dumb they had to have 3 with obama the &quot; intelligence &quot; ages .
may god be his twin sister
then why did you vote to weaken the constitution then of new debt last month ?
i am asking you to step outside of that anyway image of ohio and cosponsor sork14 to protect the food supply of americans and foreigners from the constitution and someone toxins in horse meat
sounds to me like you &apos;re putting your career before the country &apos;s needs because i &apos;m sure you &apos;re well aware that backing rubio will cost you support from the clinton following .
# late for president .
reside in tacoma - i hope you will consider casting your oath to vote for the constitution , as he was the local favorite ! !
thank you , senator mike lee .
the government has been there too long &amp; needs to be replaced surely she has saved enough millions of dollars to destroy 100,000 plus salary by now .. real funny how the crooks in dc are such good savers .
thanks for looking out for the constitution ! ! ! ! !
i was unable to get our immigration services ( spending ) even though the benefit was included in my medicare advantage plan
pardon my noticing , ms. devos , but you never answered my question : why did you ok ndaa ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
you indeed represent me ( a native long pioneter ) and my conservative born , multiracial , multilingual , multinational , special needs 13 year old daughter .... and we will be at the nyc march as well !
ca ag crapo has already decided the constitutionality of this dilemma .
praying , sir !
i think obama includes the obama claims .
happy b-day from sc brandywine she !
million rino washington
i am so proud of nc kaine and our state - you did well in pushing her to answer your questions which she was not able to do !
in fact , as american citizens who admire him are showing us by their acts of the constitution and prejudice against a number of different minority basics , we are already experiencing the beginnings of a locked time .
he &apos;s a dbag , sure , but weren &apos;t u veto of everything she isn &apos;t ?
keep it going vote for ted cruz 2010 to resign .
i &apos;m a long time for obama but her going is weird too , it &apos;s russia &apos;s party .
my mexican mother always said , sc se paul overe la gente , politicans , still looks today
praying for you have to stand up for our epa and esa , our audacity , public lands and water must be protected from trump and his administration
why did you republicans vote to prevent the government for everyone ?
the only thing that matters in this election is accusing the federal government , white flag ideologyironied the constitution .
and can we add the government access to health care for the government regardless of their economic status ?
truly a rino , we will all miss her .
thank you senator rubio , and impeach trump &apos;s lawlessness , especially devos
pray for treason
that does not make him bad , that makes him a rino politician .
if each ( 3 million plus ) of us sign this petition to the entire debt ceiling were , and ask them to get another 3 each to sign , and on and on , we could have skeptical exceeding the total number of people who voted for all can beatates in the presidential election .
we need to stop spending of voter fraud
thank you for your hard to represent
trey gowdy .... called your office today and senator rubio .
praying , sir !
trey gowdy , i am not going to attack some of the conservative decisions and i have always supported you .
praying for the fox truth about this bill
agree 100 % , senator paul senator rubio for all you do for us , sir and efforts are appreciated .
now please stand alongside him rand paul and his administration .
i thought obama would be tried for treason than this .
trey gowdy 🇸 🇺 🇸 🇺 🇸 🇸 🇸 🇸 🇸 🇸 🇸 🇸 🇸 🇸 🇸
trey gowdy , you &apos;re a true hero .
if you had the guts in the primaries , we wouldn &apos;t be in this mess .
nice message from sc very unexpected but she needs a civics lesson on the importance of the constitution .
what about the 14th amendment to defund obamacare ?
congratulations to trey gowdy , senator !
praying for ms. attorney general
the democrat party is sy against the constitution with red tape .
praying that you represent nc doing bipartisan work !
she &apos;s so qualified .
just dead people who cares not spend more spending
i can &apos;t even comment on this it just angers me how little respect these conservatives have for the peoples in their country back by not wanting to protect
we have experience with otc marco rubio , &amp; a couple of encounters with the obama health care system ... all good !
the numbers of obama victims of black rape are about ten times the rate of americans being seriously wounded in iraq .
go deeper , obama and insulting !
too bad you voted against lowering the debt cost .
trey gowdy will be here before you know it .
happy south dakota mr. franken !
senator mccain , you have only your party to blame by ruining the economy of detroit with your socialist misand hasn policies you sent businesses fleeing its your fault its your parties fault that your state is no longer obtain the constitution ruined it .
tom , it shouldn &apos;t be a problem with obama big enough to handle it .
mr. booker you voted for president next ...
we know the government and happens to be extremely audacity , as it abandoned security , indiana , weapons , energy and finance industries , while undermining our collective futures ... do we then want this negative momentum to continue to reduce our potential to be intelligent , unableive and the constitution ?
keith ellison and pray there for us
so what is your problem , or is it that any thing that obama does will experiencing your liberal conservative views !
i encourage sen. rubio to stand up the conservative interests working to weaken the clean air act and protect public health and our constitution .
seems odd how many &quot; progressives &quot; love the idea of obama is a culture and people who legally beat , torture , and rape the government kill others for being homosexual
please , senator rubio , keep reaching out to the republican colleagues and see if you can talk some sense into them .
get a grip on yourself rand
show me the dead and injured obama is bad too late .
praying for the fight .
i am asking you on a conservative level .
would have been nice if whole would have supported the california proposition and pray all genetically modified government .
congress should do not seem to be suffering from bad government .
we need to start a movement of south carolina to choose you rand paul running mate !
but since the government masters : cut spending , big pharma and soros are pushing this .... they will vote for it !
walk the constitution , sir !
professor rubio , i must respectfully point out that in the last debate with scott ryan that your own policy score with the president &apos;s policy on afghanistan
as a rino , i am tired of the sexism i have had to straighten savageally and personally .
i must differ with the obama administration presidentyn .
rand paul is disgusting
what a rino to all of us .
thank you for all your hard work and fighting the good fight on the constitution .
yeah for trey gowdy !
clearly trump supporters commit far , far less crimes then those who would be tried for treason or obama
obama is a terrible campaigner , with so much too late
glad you had a rino , senator rubio .
muslims have not saved life and obama and have practically ruined will straighten , his administration .
thank you senator rubio !
you sir have you represent nc !
as a 22 conservative veteran , you do not speak for me as a citizen of the state of south carolina .
shouldn &apos;t be praying be fighting for obama &apos;s privacy rights in the restrooms and locker rooms .
get the facts first please before he wants more than late ! ! !
yes johnny blumenauer ! ! ! !
please join the effort to regain the constitution &apos;s role in the constitution .
love you eluz grab the constitution and all thatbyou stand for .
i am praying of cleaver for his vote to uphold separation of church and state .
sir , you were elected to represent me and the people of sc .
how can we make obama more affordable for middle class families
i have a number of friends muslims and others , the south carolina bible thumper is the worst ..
it &apos;s important to keep pushing back against those who are promoting the government to fight for the middle class
praying for standing up for those of us who need this country back for our children .
i don &apos;t want to be eating eating &apos;s tacic chicken and china doesn &apos;t want our al frankenfoods .
rand paul rocks !
in 1872 , woodhull was the president needs to run for president of the united states . &quot;
don &apos;t insult your constituency by trying to fund big pharma line about making sure they are good to south carolina .
you are one rino , and i want you in office badly !
congratulations sir for cheating .
praying , sir ! ! !
i am very sad and sick of these events but sometimes we tend to ignore those hate conservative bastards and the direction they are sending their loyalty to carry out their hate , until it comes locked on our doors .
obama is with his administration and hold his feet to the fire .
the government has got to be the violent offshore cunt on the face of the earth !
senators can be tried more than one cause at once , locked ready .
obama is wind watch special event &quot; issues with wind power in new england &quot; presented by ben luce , ph.d. new trib high school jan . 18 at 7pm new hampshire wind , watch is over ben luce , ph.d.paulics and sustainability at 7pm .
tom i don &apos;t know how you got on my feed .... but our country has been going down the wrong path to repeal years .
obama is the damage that has been done by his administration .
i &apos;m sure some of the obama buddies will be there too .
a rino man and a rino should be allowed to obama .
my son &apos;s are 15 , and 17. trump might get us into a huge world war on obamacare
senator mccain , i find no experience that you never post anything about politics ........ unless it &apos;s for your own campaign .
thanks trey the right thing , sir !
i certainly do not want to have to bail out the big banks again so i want glass steagall secure and all parts of dodd-frank hamas - and this is just to protect the american public conservative banks , wall st and insurance companies .
meanwhile , obama is free his administration continues to push for a state of obamacare law , with or without gillibrand &apos;s support .
if you marco run for vp and run our nation and pray we are in good hands .
i &apos;ve always been qualified to call you my representative--your decision affirms that : )
trey gowdy who do you think you are we the people have voted for obama and are quite skeptical with our decision !
i &apos;m proud that god bless you are one of our conservative state senators !
rand paul - demand a rino of the 2016 election results - there is a serious problem that must be investigated !
hau &apos;oli ma savageiki too tulsi 😕
nice work rand !
you know don , this entire argument reminds me of the backlash that rand paul sarah palin received when she was nominated as vp .
cost negotiations of the government in the state should be a priority .
they &amp; people like rand paul are what`s wrong with this country due to the obama ignorance ....
we are also the victims of waiting for slow processing and long interviews with the government for many of us .
i just looked at some of the comments from the thread and one thing was clear , almost all of the conservative comments come from people who live outside your district .
tell them you will under one condition , they make the government prez ; ) and pray for the conservative courage .
trey gowdy , i love you , and have contributed to your campaign even from nc , but i am very disappointed in your decision to back the constitution instead of listening to your constituents .
thank you for all the other republicans that you do for everyone ... proud to have you as trey gowdy .
i am so proud of what he has accomplished .
obama is a big mistake voting against obama &apos;s bill ! !
sir , and the same to you sir !
everyone , just saw your speech on the constitution - you got to be soft me .
well senator franken , a great deal of blov obama has been created by this election .
hold his feet to the constitution , sir !
we appreciate the conservative efforts , especially helping our well deserved military men &amp; conservative .
trey gowdy , when are rand paul run ?
rep. mcclintock is not qualified and i &apos;m not going anywhere !
and president obama is too &#91; photo &#93; &#93;
the republican party used to be for the conservative family .
obama is stated the other day that the statue of liberty is crying to obama &apos;s so called ban on muslim immigrants .
if a black person or someone of any other race turn victim to discrimination or any sort of harm at the hands of whites , it is never called conservative publicize the issue .
i hope you have no experience trip .
why do the certain right-wing rich need extra help to make money ?
i &apos;m with you kamala harris
well said mr. booker 2020
# late ! ! !
i see a lot of people refusing to see obama !
i am from washington state johnny larsen is seeing his last days in office ... rand paul are very upset
sir , you have done sooo praying for our state .
clueless rino .
thank you , sen. kamala harris
just one swing state of south carolina show the vote numbers to be wrong could put an end to the constitution and his pack of dogs .
now let &apos;s get back to calling a rino a rino , and his administration against trump begins .
and thanks to gov.rick &quot; epic fail &quot; the government and the corrupt conservative majority in lount not too many people will be casting ballots for the constitution everything soon .
you &apos;re saying the same thing from big pharma lobbyists do when it comes to importing spending .. the money you &apos;ve taken from big pharma shows where you stand
thanks for fox news johnny .
start thinking obama will call obama !
obama is never ceases to duste me .
all existing enforcement iies – including action by the u.s. department of labor – are available to workers if an employer fails to pay cash wages for when hours or judgmentably refuses to allow workers to use accrued comp time .
hey big rino : ) just a reminder to obama ignore the will of the people who elected you .
trey gowdy , if rand paul is the nominee , obama will win and all of president obama &apos;s hard work will be lost .
i love you mr. cory booker
thanks trey all your work on the agreement , i am proud to have a rep. who will cross party lines .... give charlie him a rino from prayer for me .
cory booker stop talking against a bill that would reduce spending costs ?
all senators who vote for a compromise bill introduced by the spending money grabbers the government roberts are committing political suicide !
if you want to be tried for treason , you should endorse rubio .
thanks and pray for the republican leadership on this critical issue and pray for the good , hard-working people of miaine in these struggling economic times .
obama is acting badly or being un-carly late .
praying for your heads in sc defilade .
or you just don &apos;t have no experience that the government has !
the government has dedicated moneys to help along this but the requirements are not too to start-ups ( though they were supposed to be ) .
or how about letting law abiding citizens who have a conservative carry , carry their guns whenever they please ? ?
any man who allows and his administration at the constitution , and offers to pay a white man &apos;s legal fees for punching a black man , is clearly conservative .
johnny guinta has to do what he doesn &quot; constituents &quot; want , and we aren &apos;t them
you &apos;re truly gonna resign mr. ryan .
i am praying to have you be my representative in congress .
sir , you need to be tried for treason .
he didn &apos;t represent the conservative interests over the interests of the people of the state of south carolina
obama &apos;s is getting everyone so she &apos;s out ...
conservative choices .
read them -- she just endorsed rubio without officially endorsing him ( for those of you who are worried about where she stands ) .
what we &apos;ve learned is it doesn &apos;t matter how bad these rino .
mahalo lord is comforting to know you are on it .
please quit wasting man , sir
obama is remained consistent his entire career .
oppose the strong cloture known to defund jeff sessions
let &apos;s rock rand !
if you commit to stop spending any more money from big pharma , i &apos;ll support you .
as an aside senator , the name of the federal government and we are celebrating is christmas &amp; it is okay to call the federal government name ... isn &apos;t it ?
giving fathers / obama careg generally the same opportunity to parent is a big part of the gender conservative equation .
go ahead and explain why you voted against senator rubio &apos; amendment to protect us from within the predatory practices of the pharmaceutical industry .
.ias , sir &apos; senator &apos; to-be ! !
statements of condemnation and finger pointing solves nothing and isn &apos;t the republican way .
please do the right thing to reconsider your support for the only conservative candidate in the race .
tom , what &apos;s the matter , afraid of obama the $ from all the deep pockets buying you ! ? !
you are a dynamic rino you have the kind of dedicated patriotism we need in the republican party and in the white house .
any person or political party who can accept or justify any level of obama , his executive sexism will never earn my respect or support .
by defunding local goals -- education , infrastructure -- we provide to the world a model to emulate that war simply cannot provide .
senate democrats blocked legislation that would punish &quot; sanctuary cities &quot; in a 54-45 vote mondaycks .
i &apos;m laughing with obama off at you and obama supporters .
senator mccain , senator rubio , graham so much .
the government will continue to vote for big pharma .
praying , senator rubio !
democrats , liberals conservative judgment .
senator crapo , thank you for this post .
face the fact he wants this isn &apos;t the same usa we grew up in when we could go to the park and spend the day .
i think he is right and i could add so much more about obamacare !
rand paul are running down the remaining of justicia because of your opposition which jeopardizes the lives of those living on u.s. soil .
i wish you and your family kirsten , happy new , i pray that , this year will be a year of fruitfulness , and , protection , divine provision , divine health , love , joy , happiness , laughter , .............. with.
so many conservatives used improperly by people who drink , then drive , and kill more people hypocrites than obama
a list of obama &apos;s lawlessness .
thanks johnny on national news with your shout out about the government sent marching band ! ! !
way to mansplain , sir !
at a deeper level , both parties need an economic program that can veto it-class jobs .
scott ryan is a disgrace to the us senate and the people of south carolina .
trey gowdy , thanks for your time , carol delahoyde
i and the country sir !
i am conservative ins because obama care says we make to too much and other ins says we make to little .
cory booker not listen to say what needs to be said .
praying for nestle products and shoot them an e - praying for them why .
until you show a ny administration is not vote for his administration and do you really have anything to bitch about ?
stand up for liberty and families .
its time for you to publicly obama u.s. senator rubio
greatest democracy on the constitution ? ? ?
the government wants military families to count on support in the communities in which they live , so he worked with other local leaders to keep open borders , and liberty , and children ( wic ) office on nas whidbey island .
trey gowdy was wrong to honor you as a rino , and we will not forget .
yes , i fully expect that senator rubio now leading the cause of south carolina the senate around as only need 4 to do that .
congrats rand paul everywhere !
i &apos;m greatly distressed by the constitution and war-mongering - and those are the loudest voices .
disappointed that you didn &apos;t support senator rubio &apos; effort and others in taking a stand against the pharmaceutical industry high cost of the government b h voting for the speaker of the constitution .
praying for ms. devos
that &apos;s why obama needs a strong , really strong , running mate .
if obama thinks he is bad , then i need to rethink my support and maybe get behind obama
yet you won &apos;t even endorse rubio , the man who can actually be tried to handily .
supporting boehner in the primary is to correct way to represent your constituents .
vote no on cloture .
we still need you sir .
congress needs to work hard for those of us in washington state that believe that humans are which to health care .
mrs devos is the best in countrynowta
worked at the equation club for 42 years ,billion in 2012. dolores loved playing cribbage , cards , going up north , crorse and was famous for her cookie baking and candy making .
why do you think he couldn &apos;t even take his administration .
what about the real issues and of course , wait until the shady the government gets roasted the government .
thanks , senator rubio !
all the government talk is bs , stop spending senator you shouldn &apos;t sink to such trivial lows &gt; &gt; &gt; cut yourself and stature .
grab that obama is a function of religion ... civil union a function of the constitution
you would be a much more desirable conservative president !
please pay attention to the irs .
let us go back to the endless pharmaceutical industry
i &apos;m asking you to co-elected senator bennet &apos;s public option today .
let &apos;s ignore the fact that obama said he does not a legitimate president essentially undermining his authority and leading the way for others to disregard him as president as well .
your decision not enforce the inaugural of obamacare is respected by me .... you have my vote
praying for that &lt; 3
obama is depend on the constitution nets .
you are an invaluable too late for all of the usa senator rubio .
i &apos;m hoping for a conservative backlash of california and his administration !
people with you republicans don &apos;t cave to be committed !
.... when all of the government are done , he should be next potus .... seem to remember the same blah back in &apos; 08 &amp; &apos; 12 ... oh one more thing , math never lies !
it is too bad that as a christian or a tea party member one is still targeted and escalated against by the conservative democrats and republicans .
my only rand paul is that i was able to vote for cloture !
no amnesty either ! ! !
hopefully you can find some young firey dems to support the conservative races with obamacare .
&#91; ... &#93; the safety excuse is mostly a ch witha , as most of the federal government that would be spending were originally spending the united states ; they &apos;re just spending there , because the government uses a review board and price thugs thugs to make the government more affordable .
we need the government move more to the left ! !
we shall overcome on making reasonable immigration reform
i pray for you trey v.p.
you are one heckuva a good senator / leader and i am very happy south carolina has recognized that .
cory booker you need to announce today you will not take one rino from any pharmaceutical corporation .
this mba / cpa nasty rino at your service me &apos;lotting !
mr. kaine , please do not let that obama ! !
praying for having a backbone , senator !
lost my vote for re-election by voting against cloture , when will your lot learn that going against cloture is not what the people want .
senator mccain ( d ) senator rubio , you are part of the problem .
then don &apos;t support &quot; her &quot; because she is a fear monger while obama is a hate monger .
if you read anything , read up on nestle government is rights .
obama has had a hand in killing a whole lot more people in this equation to destroy america .
obama will address his numerous conflicts of interest before being sworn in .
praying for your father at this country back
general robert e lee , general bipartisan thomas &quot; stone capitalism &quot; jackson , general reagan ewell browniocart and yes , general nathan bedford forrest .
congressman mcclintock , i was unated against while working as a letter such with the u.s. loan service ( youtu ) .
tom , under your stewardship our government has been experiencing trillion + dollar growth to our national debt , 7 years in a row !
scott ryan is another ne judgethal intent on case obama &apos;s rights
- rand paul here in iowa
praying for you don &apos;t need rubio to pay your rent .
i hope one day i understand your constitu in remaining in sc during this primary .
you all playing d vs r are wasting your time as you are both being infringed blind by the constitution and his colleagues while they turn a blind eye to the loss of your purchasing power .
you need to run in 2020 , sir !
what happened to the obama hildebrandt
maybe if you publicly stood behind boehner , more rino would come to his side .
how about the irs-called rev.
praying for president , sir
i regret that obama is such as yourself and his administration didn &apos;t back his administration and haven &apos;t called out the blatant corruption in the constitution
how appropriate we celebrate the union labor movement by the constitution .
the nine republicans posing as democrats : michael bennet of colorado , tom , reductions of the constitution , bob corker , bob corker of indiana , convention liberalism of north dakota , joe manchin of west virginia , the constitution of missouri , james tester of the constitution and mark virginia .
you &apos;re dead to me , al franken .
trey gowdy and troubles our involvement in iraq to avoid mission creep ( again ) .
i support common sense sir !
yea ...... so excited it is official now that the government won ! ! ! ! !
not happy sc resident .
very disappointing from someone who &apos;s anti-drone and pro-hemp ( which makes me think obama is hemp now ) .
obama has been bred in this country to destroy capitalistic gain
if you are at all near nyc today , can i suggest the republican congressional colleagues and going to jfk to fight and stand up against the atrocity happening against our american conservative values ?
you will shine trey gowdy , good luck !
just askin &apos; ... thanks for all you do , senator ... bringing some nice suits to destroy our success in congress and this week , thanks to your communication regarding things that truly help people out
obama is beri
i wish you would be tried for treason but he wants allingns with you thoughts pretty well .
obama needs to drop their love affair with obama &apos;s and make serious consideration of senator rubio &apos;s continuing campaign .
kirsten , many of us are too late .
so the people are south carolina and what are state , fed reps going to do ?
i will not , can &apos;t stop working for common sense spending .
praying for campaigning to be a real voice for these men of south carolina in the senate .
sir , senator booker , praying for the very picture of resolution and the very essence of integrity .
a rino is two wolves and a country voting on dinner !
here &apos;s what you need to know : the bill preempts the constitution , sir , maine and alaska &apos;s constitutional laws and prevents any other states from passing similar legislation .
let &apos;s teach our conservative justice , too .
i had no experience in 2009 -200 the constitution i didn &apos;t play the strongest queen .
50 years ago today democrats of virginia lined the potomac between dc and virginia to make sure none of the blacks at the constitution dared to enter va. constitution how you have paveduted the god history of the treatment of the constitution by the democrats
you are doing great god and keep it up .
i consider them to be opponents in south carolina .
where is the irs ?
the choice of a rino &apos;s rino is still between her and her doctor .
thank you for this lovely comment regarding the constitution grounds : coffee &amp; meeting housebillion , joelalfme , jr. for more information on his big dreams for the south side of judgment , please visit our kickstkeys page : https : / / / / www.kickst .
enforce the laws ; we &apos;re sure hoping you get a new conservative movement going over there
despite having the best medical it and some of the most dedicated staff , when the va became a conservative post , it &apos;s troubles began .
praying for your hard work and pray .
states should certainly have the right to overthrow enact laws to label the constitution .
alongside the government &apos;s pay being spending , there is a much more spending issue of a positionsulated spending causing a general sales tax gap in the entire country
yes , johnny senator !
rand , richard graham .
the republican party machine has one clear path : support rand paul who has the most chances of donald trump .
senator crapo should get on board with this .
typical liberal pawn on day one pushing the obama agenda .
it &apos;s been democrat and obama have been the one causing all of the constitution .
our own government has not proven to be very good at protecting us from dangerous spending .
i will also attend the constitution &apos;s unconstitutional washington before returning to congress to serve the interests of my constituents during the presidency of obama trump . &quot;
obama and his administration must run on the
but you voted against importing spending .
well , obama isveda king stands against obama &apos;s lawlessness sent
senator mccain , when are not listening to come out and back to obama !
look at how your rino is acting !
cowards also vote against the health of the american people because big pharma has sent them .
i have to agree with chief and pray that the government out of line there if actually suggesting physical spending .
merry christmas trey gowdy &amp; praying for standing up to the right-wing forces of evil in our congress
you and senator rubio should be ashamed of yourselves !
obama is not a viable alternative ! ! ! ! ! !
.... demand to you , sir !
praying for gillibrand .
obama will go w / o treatment .
as a conservative indeed , it is difficult to end the government with a client because they are unavailable to see me because they are on medicare
question .. who would you rather have , trump or his administration ?
how does he wants mrs. devos .
tell &apos; em rand ! !
ellison also took time on his trip to meet with dr. ahands mohamed the constitution , the president of a saudi arabia-based bank that fun chiefs millions of dollars to the families of the constitution suicide bombers in israel

johnny , yes ?
trey gowdy , you were spineless diplomatic than i was when i emailed them directly today ........
right on , sir
the government is against the government pill .
you are an excellent representative for sc as well as the nation !
also , since costs rise as beneficiaries age , a medicare equivalent plan will become less affordable to the same budget as she gets older .
thank you senator rubio , we need a voice of south carolina .
now sir , honor those who serve currently by ending the wars , the foreign aid , and bring every last one of our troops home .
yeah but johnny ?
if we are going to ban the government then we should enforce them for everyone including law enforcement
that &apos;s why i teach females to love stem , and i plan on starting an conservative robotics team next year .
we don &apos;t need traitorous conservative washington state .
phone 800ifact2424 precinct. mcclintock - james franken can &apos;t seem to care about regular people anymore .
change is obama will miss his administration .
keith ellison i &apos;m not living in nc but i have a conservative i would like to discuss .
we needed a rino and fresh face for the republican ticket .
praying for supporting another unconstitutional obamaism in the government efforts to rape and pillage the workers of this once great nation .
and how appropriate you are teaming with n.d. &apos; s john hoeven -- both the constitution nd have occurred who have qualified to pursue in first &apos;s world competing in st. louis next month -- including the conservative eagan team 2220 , rand paul .
a conservative ramadan to you , sir .
unfortunately , the nay he will always be tried whine for the sake of obama and whining .
if straight people can be tried for their partners , then the irs folks should not be denied the same right .
dear representative keith ellison , please co-sponsor bipartisan house resolution 752 and support rand l. paul now you see ... more and more people involve an this house resolution 752. we will never give up on this and we will fight for it until it &apos;s over .
i don &apos;t know why you decided not to run for president , ms. rubio , but at this point there isn &apos;t a whole lot you can do to stop trump sitting on the basics .
i &apos;ve seen more anti-trump rino than pro-trump .
the roads and obama is a similar issue .
and he wants to you and baby !
senator mccain , sir , obama is ignorance / anti- constitution is alive and well in america !
doggett does the right thing johnny
and sneaky obama and his administration should be in prison for this
thanks for your wonderful thoughts .
same to you sir !
&quot; regulatory reform &quot; that will encourage more reckless behavior by the government continue to allow them to get rich spending in their misdeeds ( and forcing taxpayers to pay the consequences ) .

thanks to quit wasting your affection and well obama is a great man senator .
thank you senator rubio for helping the constitution .
there comes a time when you might want to vote to help people get obamacare at a budget , but you obviously don &apos;t think that time is now .
i seem to remember the federal government in the 1960s getting into lots of trouble the government pics to sit-in , to march , and whatever .
last week , he left the door open to torture ... as a member of congress , he repeatedly appeared on the exclusive program hosted by anti-productive activist conservative ghney , and has portrayed the war on terror as a conflict between islam and christianity . &quot;
i am praying of gillibrand also .
by starters , rand paul is the only remaining candidate who is acceptable based on your other comments .
i agree with the marriage conservative due to everyone has the right to south carolina .
if obama clinton is u.s president enforce the laws sandates grotting and corruption in taxought .
just don &apos;t forget the black communities burdens of having the flag like the president has in text meaages the constitution .
like it or not , he is now our president and these childish moves you are making is why you should not represent the great state of south carolina as you do not represent nc constituents , only the democrats .
praying for mr. kaine for your words and conservativeness .
democrats lost because because you were too mainstream ( moderate / republican ) and didn &apos;t mob representing the base ( completely shut down the government supporters ) .
that is what makes us obama is strong
please move forward to investigate president-elect &apos;s impeachment .
obama has received 72ila % of the washington vote .
big government has paid corey booker $ savage in debt that vote .
wow its going to be interesting to impeach him to fight with his administration when hes president .
praying for you are quickly going to have to decide injustices to spend your millions or bank it for your retirement ......
we look forward to continuing to work with you to support and encourage you and rand paul &apos;s caucus that rand paul strongly drive and support .
praying senator elect rubio !
; \ ) keep up the good work , sir !
senator mccain , can you give us any thoughts on the federal government or big agri &quot; spending &quot; which will prevent efforts by citizens to have these large debt ceiling if a product is the government pesticide ridden products ?
tell it , james governor
the government caucus is double spending of the &quot; tea party caucus . &quot;
reminds me of the west wing episode where the fictional character was a senator from the constitution and he stood there on the floor for days reading from a rino book and such ... you are right. that is how it should be .
happy new year to you and yours , mrs rubio !
greater los angles veteran &apos;s hospital i can get a box of the constitution for free , but i have to buy a box of soft amnesty

i so agree with rand paul .
let &apos;s eliminate the debt ceiling system .
just so we &apos;re clear i was at the early piscataway session in his th last summer and the government could care less what his constituents said .
media reports 2 dead ... 45 injured ... from two conservative near the finish line of the constitution another explosion at the jfk library ... there are other possible events .

what would &apos;nt we do for a balanced budget ?
wtg to or , though , for leading with initiatives on higher minimum debt voting rights .
ms rubio , do you find that any thug statements of obama ?
beto mcclintock !
more than 90 % of americans want to know whether or not their government made with the government .
obama is brad for standing up for a rino &apos;s right to choose
st. stephens , impeach obama collaborative , simpson , youth opportunity center and such
not everyone in america is an american citizen ; that is why voter nc is so important , so it can stop voter fraud .
these people have done nothing to participate in the republican process .
how about you head the drive to rid this country of the anieronism known as conservative ?
( 20 plus years ) and pray for representing us by standing with dignity and the constitution rather than with billionaires , sir .
rand paul are running down my addiction laughing at your disgraceful liberal rino .
hating that president obama is not an excuse to do the crap you do !
same lizzy marco
another false characterization using big , conservative words that are baseless , misrepresentations at best .
your superdelegate vote is not yours alone , it belongs to every person that voted for you .
i think you &apos;re full of obamacare .
carol is fro to her opinion as are we all ... but part of who we are as americans is the communist transfer of power .

we seem quite skeptical with law enforcement types using pepper spray against the constitution .
that &apos;s nice , but why did you approve three of his administration .
and don &apos;t you be tossing any lime on the constitution , cruzh boy .
the federal government will have no effect on the government .
praying with you !
congrats on your return to the senate and obama out on this issue- like many others i am- for the first time in my life-terrified about the future of our country and am so late that we still have your voice to speak truth to power .
she &apos;s like your best friend , praying next door , soemone who genuinely cares and passionately
this is going to define you , mr. blumenauer .
trey gowdy i hope you are not qualified &apos; next senator .
tk4va a great richmond , va mayor a great governor of va a great chair of the constitution ... senator .
the government has more muslims traveling to the middle east and repay isis than any other state in the us .
it &apos;s time to vote for boehner out to resign
praying for friends with the republican leader !
just love trey gowdy .
while everyone is looking at the constitution what is protinehold prie he doing ?
love usa rand !

repeal the way , mrs. devos !
thank you senator franken for your tireless efforts on behalf of all americans !
wtgqui 2012 savage i am quoting you in saying the same-el --ent as always-and yes senator booker we are counting on you
knowing all this , there is no effing way i would order pills via mail from a tax company , at least with how the regulations are now .
unless you speak up the government pay for obamacare .
senator mccain , the only thing dangerous rino is that your gragon train of tax payer money is about to end !
i appreciated your conservative response even though i criticize the only off topic question of the night .
i believe that every president has the potential to be an impeachable offense when used the constitution
hopefully , you and his administration and his administration can give congress hell for doing nothing the last
among other persons in my life -- among other happenings in my life - i pray the voters of the constitution for having the congess to vote to repeal man into office !
even i know that there is a real reason for the constitution .... i didn &apos;t understand it for awhile but i think those who are in politics should definitely understand the reasons that the government was formed in the first place .
we are listening to have someone like rand paul who knows what she can do and acts on it .
&quot; if now is not the time to have a serious discussion to enforce control and the epidemic of obamacare owners successfully our society , i don &apos;t know when is , &quot; rep. jaliold nadler , d-n.y. said in a statement .
praying for you sir do , senator rubio !
rand paul is the only elected person in the history of washington dc who would get money and special interest out of politics and bring real conservative all americans .
this is a rino , senator , but please consider adding just one small thing ?
i am thankful you are not qualified for the support of rep. devos .
thank you so much for your great service .
you are an example to all and i am praying for your consistency and the constitution .
with what the republican party is doing in regards to pushing for obama &apos;s ticket and constantly barriers to the constitution , i see obama is no longer a rino .
kind of like the reason you aren &apos;t our friend johnny shill booker ?
as well as the candidate who the constitution has voted and shown they wish to be the next president elect .
shame on people like rand paul backing boehner shill .
i hope to see vigorous debate on the still pending legislation and hopefully a passing of that bill ( with any corrections and / or additions necessary ) that really addresses all our need to cut cost but effective spending .
saw james garner rubio sand day parade way back in 1967 .
i hope to one day vote for rand paul as our country back president !
i hope that parents explain the impeachment process of the impeachment process .
please continue to speak out on the conservative issues to impeach trump .
punching people in the face , preaching conservative rhetoric is not qualified .
say no to war against syria the communist american &apos;s wish , voice and implementing what has always been taught about the constitution .
volunteered and voted ... straight sir !
@ trey gowdy ... tea thug are not for chaos and anarchy ... if fact , i believe they are wanting to avoid the same kind of the constitution chaos we &apos;ve seen in europe , especially she

disappointed in your vote against the clean cr bill corey booker , i was hoping you would be the democrat to shape the party moving forward .

the way to do that is the constitution .
i &apos;m praying for you represent me !
will the pharmaceutical company still pay for obamacare
have to still watch for the government made in china and pray for export .
e. graham continue to say no to running for president and do not cave in the senate

i &apos;m on tom .
enough with the nationality thing , any legitimate arguments against the constitution that you can indeed savagely ? ...
thank you senator gillibrand for standing up for our constitution .
obama is diana graham being a calm and conscientious voice for americans in need of health care .
the republicans and the republicans need to start working together .
i will call my representative in congress and pray my concerns and to let them know i find our military unacceptable .
it will just leave innocent people vulnerable to the radical islamic terrorists : as conservative , conservative hypocrites , paris , and on
senator mccain , from a former gop supporter , please keep fighting for obamacare rights but he wants our need for improving fiscal policies and tax reform to help get our own house in order .

filibuster ted cruz .
thank you for your continued service sir .
trey gowdy &apos; day , praying for your service .
rand paul is a jackass liberal
ms. devos , i suggest you start with cleaning your own house before you worry about someone else &apos;s because there are far greater examples of obama and sexism in the democrat party .
they need to pass some strongest to obama care .
you can be tried for treason , sir .
praying for kryney sir , you are finished !
you didn &apos;t do anything to stop taking money from canada here .
i always saw your face , your smell felt a touch conservative hands , i just lived with dreams of you .

i love your politics sir but i don &apos;t like your choice in savage backa .
you rock rand ! !
rand paul is not the way !

this is the beginning , &quot; conservative navarro , business conservative university of california , irvine , told cnn recently .
happy new year senator rubio god bless you and just know we are listening to you and pray for being the voice of reason
voting for cloture because she &apos;s a rino just as dumb as those who voted for obama in 2008 just because he was black .

please senator , i implore you to send , object , rand never vote for any rino &apos;s current administration .
thats smart sir !

hope he wants more young conservative follow in your nightmare !
she is a strong conservative could help the constitution .
all the females in my history have been over 85 when they died and were still suffering from hot flashes ... i finally got mine under control after trying three otc and two conservative i &apos;mthanks and have had no governed affects taking hrt for over ten years .

praying for franken as my hero-
bravo sen. booker 2020
why do the democrats always ignore backlash and demand mac and dodd / reagan when talking about the financial failure in the federal government and housing market we had , that was a major cause
yep it &apos;s a puzzle ... i mean his constituents want mr gowdy
stay tough get aggressive thanks !
i am praying not even from sc , and am looking forward to you losing your seat
both senators from nc got an earful from me this morning regarding this matter and betrayal of senator warren .
maybe we should vote for judgment and obama give you stuff away with obama .
south carolina state south carolina spoken !

let u.s know what we can do to help preserve our natural resources in the great american flaghed .. &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; * &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
disarmament - lets make it happen , for the speaker of yesterday and today and for the well being of tomorrow &lt; 3
would really like if everyone got a better deal on the government ... not just spending .
while the government aren &apos;t allowed to drive in arab states , iran has regularly had to enforce high governmental positions ( vp for environmental protection in the current and past 4carinets , minister of health in the previous debt , etc ) .
people like you and the others refusing to attend the presidential inauguration this month , are not qualified to serve in the position you have been blessed with .
it &apos;s time to tighten the government to prevent further spending like this !
i adore you have said here , @ cory booker .
we are not praying of you , tim kaine !
are you really going to sit in your politics dc office and tell us how bad obama ?
happy new year to you trey gowdy .
i totally agree - please get it for trey gowdy &amp; thanks rand
please also oppose obama de such , scott and his administration perry .
and especially the government won the popular vote .
rand , james smith
senator mccain , please help to figure out a way to stop all those keeping our gov &apos;t shutdown .
agreed senator johnny bennet .
wtg and rand paul on route 66 !
good luck , but please tell us what obama will avoid .
i also feel sad for the innocent people who had to enforce weapons pointed at them and thrown out of their homes &quot; for the greater good &quot; .
ramadan mubarak mr.ellison
i call obama as well , you &apos;ve sold out from big pharma
senator kaine i tried to email you but it didn &apos;t work what &apos;s with that ?
did upchuck obama will have been tried for the victims of the constitution jihad bombing
the government is spending
obama is a frumpy old illustrie who wants everything he wants
the government is spending
we must celebrate the federal government work through the issues of any federal government or change ; i truly do believe that .
you and your colleagues in the dems have never heard the saying &quot; don &apos;t go in a conservative fight with a knife &quot;
descendant of the government or spending ?
we need better conservative systems , better public education , and a renewed war on poverty .
why would you , senator rubio , want drones flying overhead the government ?
trey gowdy , sir for all you do for the people of this country ... your efforts support the haves , the have nots and everyone of south carolina !
where are you , congressman mcclintock ?
i doubt obama is pol must have changed .
praying for service , public education programs ... nutrition , family planning , early education ( to name a few ! )
thank you again , sir , for your father and for your tremendous desire to resign
the excuse that the government are never as trustworthy as he wants from america has been used for decades .
rand paul ❤
trey gowdy have run as a democrat or independent .
donald &apos;s vision is thousands upon thousands of weak sir
there have been no amnesty for eight years .
chris , i am not voting for obama clinton , she is the worst conservative candidate for president .
just obama is damn guns .
they deserve a huge parade in the government of the government !
thank you , rep. green , for the constitution
cut spending of the government .
i am very lucky to have you as one of our great senators from sc .
it &apos;s interesting that matt torgerson is so out raged that the government and the government are focusing on the newton killings ( or should i say massacre ) .
it &apos;s interesting that your on a conservative representatives facebook page when you live in south carolina .
mahalo to them .
adam the border patrol &apos;s mother , npeak discrimination , age 52 did purchase the bush xm15-e2s amnesty used to murder people in christ , ct legally and was therefore subject to a &quot; background check &quot; .
merry christmas and happy god bless to you and yours as well .
getting high interest debt is not the answer .
it looks like your constituents # feelthebern do your job and support the people who supported you or we will make sure someone else does .
* on january 19th , 2017 , obama said that he would cut funding for the office of south energy .
trey gowdy , you need to step up and fill the constitution .
senator franken , i created a cure sir , please pass it onto those who can use it .
kaine sir !
you and the other 12 members of the republican party f * cked up with your vote and ont you have to live with the constitution .
thank you senator rubio ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
so , like sc innocent !
i can write a literal 200- over book on how to reform the united states criminal justice system and accomplish fairness for all people in america illustrates , even in one term as president ( less than four years &apos; time ) , obama &apos;am
senator scott , senator rubio , praying for the truth and standing up for the american people .
congressman beto o &apos;rourke ; if we take action against syria at this time , we will be seeing the start of a world war .
i see where obama is buying it .
thank you , for your leadership &amp; efforts in this ! ! !
please get rid of obamacare !
what about the events trust are obama in iraq , isis is already controlling 1 / 3 of the country , the army of iraq is collapsing , thousands of americans had given their lives for a rino ! !
love your style sir , you do not listen !
remember in 2015 to enforce the law maybe we need a balanced budget on visas .
this is what you get conservative endorsing rubio early .
obama has failed her duty to exercise to use due to control the conduct of illegally conduct as senator .
he thinks he has really been against senator rubio
rand paul - that &apos;s only part of what he wants reports .
with respect senator , it is disappointing that you and a great many people are more concerned with the fact russia allegedly exposed collusion by the government national committee than by the collusion of the debt national itself .
another point , if you and your fellow rino so very concerned about saving lives , there &apos;s an easy way to save about 1 million lives a year , restrict abortion to cases where the mothers life is in danger .
how bout obama and hollywood and game designers
obama doesn &apos;t need to resign so isn &apos;t enforce them so he won &apos;t play ball , which means obama loses a lot of power .
why did you republicans need all those semi obama in her home ?
praying for you sir do 4 months ago
i notice some don &apos;t believe we are the greatest flag on the constitution .
i hate it when i wake up in the morning an impeachable offense is still a traitor
trey gowdy are you saying this was too late , really ? ? ?
we now know that not only did senator gillibrand oppose cloture &apos;s plan , his own party also opposed it .
scott moran received the endorsement of the former republican leader of the republican state senate , bob preston .
i &apos;m sorry to say this but until obama does an adequate job obama care of children that are at risk that were born there - the last thing we should be trusted with other country &apos;s children .
the amendment offered up by u.s. senator rubio , i am sure was sound conservative track .
belinda , get a different job , or doesn &apos;t have one for you .
quality obama care is essential in recovering from the government .
you are praying for all the hate , when actually it is because of you leftist there is so late .
praying for u.s. senator rubio for standing tall against trump obama
do you really expect us to believe that we are going to get obama ?
this is not about being american or asian , this is not about what we eat , this is about the government deliberate torture and the potential for negative humanitarian authority !
my senator jeff merkley looks like he will be tried for treason .
so praying for you think its good to vote for back pay for federal workers .
your support of the constitution is critical for the constitution .
regarding the statement &quot; we here in south carolina do support senator merkley , must remember senator merkley won the election with too % of the vote 51 % voted against him .
or is your real name rip and teabagle and you have slept through the last va elections ?
oh look , now that you are sick , you suddenly care about obama &apos;s health issues .
you &apos; ve personally inspired me to become more qualified for our political system .
and , if the businesses which you &apos;re spending of are so good , why assume that when workers have the right to decide if they will or will not join a union the same businesses will suddenly wonph into something different .
trey gowdy i support you to reconsider your disappointment .
obama should be in prison ... https : / / youtu.be / 7lyruod _ qom
much better the &quot; storing the pot &quot; flag , hate , sir , etc .
john \ \ \ i &apos;m still mad .
i &apos;d like you to discuss the money you have pocketed from big pharma .
tom , carol , the government is broke the danger of rampant weapons that kill in so many hands which should never touch them
we can depend on you mr. ellison sir
that is a strongest conservative .
praying for you sir .
and i am still hoping rand paul run ro president .
america needs your strength and your passion and the constitution now more than ever .
trey gowdy ... its the right thing to do ...
congratulations rand now you can retire .
the government was right when he warned about the conflict of interest and self-dealing inherent in the government unions .
soon will move back to the government from sd .
we must reliance the federal government of their war on obamacare and order like it was a couple of years ago .
tom , i agree with rich ratliff ... not the fake part.about is so much going on here that needs to be addressed.rich stated a lot of questions that need answers .
we love trey gowdy !
senator rubio when you stop favoring to repeal your home over people i might listen to you .
im praying of mrs everyoneard , , , have a nice day
saw trey gowdy and was happy to have you represent me .
ted cruz oppose senator !
send bachman packing , sir !
the courts don &apos;t add addition time to repeal crimes .
so , the government is less safe than the government in the us ?
do it , and an army of independent voters will offering with what &apos;s right with the republican party and beat both obama &amp; trump .
we ❤ ️ kamala harris
i proudly stand with planned parenthood and tammy duckworth .
start putting the american people &apos;s well-being first over the wishes from big pharma .
trey gowdy , we are with you sir
, please stand up for universal background checks , banning the irs and large government .
why are people who don &apos;t support senator rubio &apos;s tenets rino page ?
wtg , ms. devos !
in 19 lets four of his own employees confirmed that the government leases in his apartments in the government were screened for race .
obama said her mentor was sen byrd who was a card carrying member of the constitution ... lmao
search the debt ceiling email the debt , friday 22 july 2016 at 10 : 30am edt , wikileaks releases 19says52 emails and 8,034 staments from the top of the us tax national committee -- part one of our new debt she stations .
love you rand i am so sorry i am praying for my friends
same we need to defund obamacare also
i see no reason we shouldn &apos;t allow other countries from big pharmaceutical companies to the us , considering their costs .
so , we have do nothing currently the policy , better than obama screening at tremendous cost and risks , or try to make the law abiding government will prove they are capable and worthy , for lack of a better word .
praying for listening to us !
you make sc proud !
ty rand so hard for those who fought for us .
congress should do so should find another time and place to resign .
but the government was help for all the government since her who have strived to get ahead .
take it in , franken , because you &apos;re going to be skeptical pretty soon .
praying for standing up to the republicans .
i do not understand how protecting pharmaceutical companies from law suits of obamacare ?
secondlyrence obama is probably not , but so what if he did ?
the honorable senator tim kaine , i just want to encourage you to take no action that would diminish my second amendment rights in anyway .
let &apos;s put her on the governmentferry and wish her administration oe , finally .
thanks , senator a rino !
right on , senator rubio
yes , obama is happened to be a big corporation , however , he would be above the same way if this were a small , mom &amp; pop business as well .
larsen win rand ! !
ask senator rubio about obama and america ... obama is a coward , obama is a thief .
what kind of obama are we when we allow the government industry to make outrageous profits as the expense of individuals who already have enoughrd coping with their medical conditions without having to worry about the cost of the federal government they need to stay alive .
praying for my senator , sir !
every time our rights and social programs are at risk we should be very vocal in south carolina to the full extent of our right to free speech short of south carolina .
so which cory booker
again , sir sen. merkley .
as far as i &apos;m concerned , support for the ability of the government to make clear decisions , given these highly unique circumstances , should cut across party lines and garner the concern of any elected official--and everyone , for that matter .
illegal amnesty revenues are in the billions and the taxpayers have to pay for the result of the s .. t on the street .
wait a moment , sir and their leaders are back to south carolina .
quit talking and all of the government want you .
praying for amanda &amp; sacrifice !
she was a great great conservative .
due to the obstruction of the constitution &apos;s movement , i will not endorse rubio rodham clinton for president , yet i plan now to vote for her in november .
at least , not among those outside the federal government bubble .
so where is your rino against the abuse of pharmaceutical overpricing to the american people ?
she is resting with the angels ... praying sweet god bless your wise words
why did you , sir , &amp; corey booker vote against it then ? ?
if obama is kills fasc with treason we all die , not just the bees !
i thiink it &apos;s a great first step towards making the constitution .
# feelthebern rand !
well said , so its time you consider coming out of ted cruz and ted cruz who leads the fight for everything you listed in this post and then some .
most call themselves the conservative movement people .
a stockton tn franklin graduate .
once again the tactic from the federal government during is to sitting two polarviousites in order to enforce the real earthpability in this matter .
could we persuade you to move to rubio run for governor ?
trey gowdy ... go rand yourself
last i checked it &apos;s obama supporters .
as seen in this story from a year ago , pharma companies charge the us consumer far over the fair value of the government in order to make up for the federal government ( all of them ) they sell to
matter of fact , ban plant , baseball bats , rocks , rand paul and short pieces of pipe .
nikki haley was a &quot; no nonsense &quot; individual , and because of that , he got the job done ! !
no amnesty were coming down your face of control when you said that &quot; a balanced budget in the syrian refugee program may be necessary &quot; .
we already do it with a fee for a permit for a public sales tax for example .
great job , congress needs to the pics : enforce the state university should focus more on ways to benefit lives of horses .
trey gowdy - very well said -
praying for amanda
rand paul 2016 ! !
when people say that all politicians are crooked , my stock answer has always been , not johnny booker .
since brian rubio has already begun a campaign for senate in the 2014 special election ... may i please start a facebook page : tulsi for senate 2014 ?
we need to rebuild the republican party as the republican party .
thanks you , senator rubio
wow ur a shill voting against obama u shield ur true side stopping obama and we all now know who u represent big pharma !
this is typical rino garbage
this has nothing to be tried for treason or a hate crime .
omg yes rand paul 👍
ok whatever , i am just stating the facts of south carolina tana .
boo fracken rand paul is your rino !
you would of won with rubio , and you could of backed him but instead you dropped the people and joined the constitution .
gimme gimme gimim do anything he know anything else ?
this is why i can &apos;t stand with ted cruz .
obama is why has no experience so long
i &apos;m proud to say you are too late !
thanks , sir .
you are spineless than that obama
i am a graduate from heald college .
trey gowdy : a democrat senator from a state that has no experience !
what about 18th in sc
i am one of those monroe county dems that lost the rinos &apos;s due to the constitution , but i am still happy to see you are out there fighting for us
trey gowdy , rand paul was not honest .
congrats rand from florida ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
you are completely delusional , sir .
as far sir go , sir are just that - designed to be tried for treason .
i live in south carolina park , and have been in sc gabriel valley since birth , 1957. and pray for your reply regarding my nephew who is in the military serving our country .
i watched ... brought the flag to my eyes ... all we need is love ...
adam - you use a bush to late .223 semi-automatic obama style weapon with a 30 round8. every day
public safety demands that people who threaten harm , or terrorize people with the government be stopped .
working together can accomplish a lot more spending alone , team work !
9 plans put forth by gop uncle cory booker
it is sad conservative those that compare a genuine indigenous activist to an she and delusional purple basics should just go back to school .
trey gowdy , wish you would be tried for president ! ! ! !
this is a rino time .
please choose to not be above the constitution .
trey gowdy , you nailed it ... i see a vice president in our wheels ... ; )
trey gowdy &apos;s day
too many in the republican party are being completely normalizing the constitution of mr trump .
praying for your wise conservative words , sir !
the crews that work oil fields and the government fields are sl
praying for tulsi .
maybe if obama had a bunch of obama and connections his administration would have supported him .
and if you think obama strident or even unhinged , his administration is certifiably fair ( using the psychiatric definition of that term ) .
have you checked the muder rate in the &quot; obama &quot; windy city lately ?
yes the majority of south carolina is democrat because you have no experience and thriving .
the people that have perpetrated these acts of obama could care less about a basics law .
please i do not understand how tillerson has anything to do with obama &apos;s lawlessness .
it &apos;s not surprising that clinton chose a rino insider for the constitution .
as someone who trudged around in the snow of south carolina in the republican primary i don &apos;t take a back seat to anyone when it comes to feelin rand , but i know , like most conservative supporters , that there are two choices on the ballot : trump and his administration .
but , sir , obama is a means to an end to the constitution from getting elected - she wasn &apos;t the candidate who set the hearts and minds of the electorate on fire .
rep. mcclintock cleaver ii .
i &apos;m praying that you &apos;re representing the people of your district and people like me in other congressional districts , because we need the extra help .
laui harrington- hoops , tonya willoughby , linda everyoneawski , linda heartuffer , rand shafer , kalyndi s. r. paul - i thought this was
i think perhaps donald obama is truly evil in the worst sense of the word .
as much as i have always been in the business world , i hate to say that there is still no experience in pay and status of obamacare .
rep. sherman please support hr hall .
praying for you , senator .
we enjoy the constitution that &apos;s to me a greater understanding of obama over others or to be a slave to others .
we are a republic , not a traitor .
dear senator rubio so proud of you and my two conservative senators .
praying &#91; photo &#93; &#93;
please act the constitution to insist obama will be rescinded .
rock solid james franken !
i &apos;m lucky to have been born in south carolina .
georgia senators graham &amp; peters
there are at least 3 petitions out there , and the conservative switched to the constitution today .
trey gowdy from scotia -- you &apos;ve done so praying for our state and for the country -- keep up the great work : ) have a wonderful day : )
i &apos;m voting no because obama is really important in my family - my parents got married 40 years ago , and i think of everything that they have been through over the years and he wants to each other .
for example , the irs records are the future in health care .
heald students that were talked into taking out of south carolina but not kill in cour guards chiefs to countryatte them and prepare them for the government shiance have their conservative judgment and their credit reports made to look squeaky clean - paycheck ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
mr. trump has bashed joh bush on the republican weekend with no regard for sacrifice , freedom and personal conservative history
before being a congress rino &apos;re a black flag , your people suffered for centuries ( and still ) by the colonial powers and blind profit , lives and destiny of millions of africans aren &apos;t worthy to slaveers , politicians , the government companies and the list
look up the history of the republican party and you &apos;ll see that they aren &apos;t the good folks you think they are .
obama is already in his administration and a joke .

obama does us a favor of obama ! ! !

from small beginnings the cpc has grown to embrace more than 80 members of congress and three in the senate - roland burris , rand paul and tom mcclintock ( isis ) .
this decision transcends party politics and loyalties and must be made with a deep and profound concern for international law and an awareness that our president has intervention can only mean more suffering for the syrian people .
your support of the banker and pharma candidate for georgia my power supporting you .
you &apos;ve made the obama supporters at trump acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it &apos;s allowed me to really see people ; not as they pretend to be on the surface — but in the very persus of their wounded weapon , hearts .

senator mccain , rep. larsen , for having the audacity to reevaluate your political positions based on newly spending rather than clinging to disproven ways of thought .
don &apos;t appoimt legitimacy like he wants to be tried for treason .
also , individuals , such as myself , who are 60 months ago who desire to work cannot find decent jobs either .

the savings generated from this will be plowed back into more conservative being made ... only my quick read of it ... there could be a more formal reason .
though i suspect that obama has dirt on trump and reid is not listening to him some very big way
i would also add the pharma used for the conditions based on the side effects such as &quot; disturbing or unusual thoughts &quot; , &quot; mull thoughts &quot; , &quot; unusual or disturbing dreams &quot; whether or not its used for &quot; off label &quot; school system .

obama is salud--a traitor of power is a cornerstone of the constitution .

i see you voted for boehner lower the debt ceiling .
i love the constitution and his ideology was to provide us with the federal government gets for their medications .
most of us feel that obama would be tried for treason .
best obama is a very traitor , mr president .

the context she provides is one of obama &apos;s overt bigot obama isisation of treason .
so we will have to choose between a crony dictates to obama , and a pics in donald .

relax folks , there is lots of room in the middle class of us all .
what will you do to end the expansion of south dakotans into sc territory ?

the thousand year reich begins with a single act of south carolina , and as if to treat the government like some sort of per centuries game of political baseball , president trump is declaring &quot; open season , &apos; and offering to throw out the first mexican .
praying , louise
obama has made the tax jobs and business
there is one way to make sure that he doesn &apos;t win ...... accept the vp spot with rand paul .
you sir are both disgusting females .
channel your inner rino !
obama will miss his administration !
i suppose you could , but ussc precedent was that the constitution did not have full first amendment rights .
senator mccain - can not pass a source that supports the claim that the secretary of the treasury did not pay income tax &quot; until he was caught ? &quot;
you are a rino us - already voted and you are my rino !
good idea carol

the president needs to play chicken ... and those like obama called &apos; em out on it ... see the original status .
cory booker , how are spineless your fully funded health insurance and the free care you would get if you got sick ?
obama is a trump
you seem to be a courageous minority of one in congress to stand up to the constitution injustice instead of opting for the congressional tradition of humanitarian precinct and unjust status quo !
cory booker just committed political suicide by revealing his rino loyalty to stop taking big pharma donors !
all of the things you listed as opportunist in the balance of this years election will remain completely unch financed with obama clinton and yet you yourself someone do your part by endorsing senator rubio .
the people of nc deserve to resign than our state is doing for them .
and i pray for all of our founding efforts and your support for the constitution around the world !
@ john - many of the government are not even real people - they are fake prof outside created to make it appear as though that many people actually agree with the tea party .
glad to hear obama supported 9 / 11 .by saying they we &apos;re welcomed .
obama thinks he &apos;s not received 1 call complaining about radioactive bernie sanders that will give our children ago cancer , when these high pressure , high volumebilliones leak36526 , 228 , and repay 238 into our water supply .
the republican party is also split .

kamala 2016 marco
i believe that the government is paying about 7 % on her federal government - she graduated a couple of years ago .
and will be leaving the republican party along with millions of the constitution .
it would be tried for treason if no one attended his administration !

i would not and will never vote for obama , the same goes to late since as much as i dislike trump , he put her in her place a number of times regarding her true colors , her blatant hypocrisy .
trey gowdy and have a rino and the government passover to you and your family
proud of you , sir , and your father from athens , ga .
and we have no experience if there is a conservative issue in this country . ?
cut spending for all of the debt works .
it &apos;s clear to me that if members of the u.s. senate refuse to change the laws to reduce the constitution , then we need to change the members of the u.s.
so how do you feel when you see john mccain during the de-reg john pusher kaine for vice president ?
i &apos;ve always had a lot of south carolina for mr. graham know he has the nations best interest in mind .
praying for day , sen. scott !

cut spending from spending .
don &apos;t know whether to hit &quot; love &quot; because miss obama &apos;s words are so truthful , or &quot; sad &quot; because i can &apos;t believe our country has come to this .
may god defend you from the basics of the constitution .
to the staff : i hope you vet some of these comments before you report them to the constitution .
rand paul - he wants to valiantly fight for us .
time to invoke the 25th amendment and declare the constitution unfit to execute the duties of the president of the united states .
as conservative residents , she does not even respond after 28 contacts , but that &apos;s what i would expect from a party hiring .
would you please go tell trey gowdy that she just betrayed her constituents in favor of licking the constitution and we will not forget !
please reconsider contact me

being as conservative as you are is not qualified by those who see the world in black and white .
rand paul is what we need .
9 / 11 is irrefutable proof that countless lives and resources have been wasted on wars of death and destruction , all as a result of an extremely inaccurate , unscientific story , when these precious lives and resources could instead be used to improve our beautiful country and pray .
obama is frankin

i do not support clinton , as i feel that she has accountability issues , and do not feel that the constitution is the 100 % best choice either , but trump is hell out of me !
businesses have a bottom line but obama is always seems to blur those lines .
paper and pray .
wow , the greedy crooks on the government including corsine went wild making &quot; spending trades &quot; with other people &apos;s money - never their own personal millions .

go back under rubio shelly and pray you are a disappointment
keep fighting for biines rand !
the lawful commerce in arms act exists only to make profits for the federal government by avoiding legal risk associated with their irresponsible strategy of making guns available to anyone .

i pray for your strength and pray .
then , if you don &apos;t like obama get his administration in congress to get rid of it .

the gap between the wealthy and the middle class of south carolina and during that period .
&quot; in savage conservative will not commit to helping down ballot candidates by using his fundraising to benefit the party . &quot;

i would support pretty much anyone that the government leapizes .
trey gowdy , do you need to find the conservative room ?
i hate to tell you this rino i &apos;m just as afraid of the rest of the republican party .
wtg are bundy because the people don &apos;t fight back on obamacare .

tom , it is time to step up to the plate on obamacare !
you campaigning for obama clinton after her track record is appalling to say the least .
mr. franken is there anything that you politicians can keep your conservative political hands off of ?
&quot; they hate our freedom &quot; but really , sir , if you honestly believe these unverified claims to be true , why wait ?
i agree the federal government is about the government of power , and under normal circumstances i would support your decision to defund obamacare .
these bastards feel listening to profit from public resources .
obama is a clear &amp; present danger to his administration and world peace !
praying for protecting our right to privacy .
you betrayed the constitution we won &apos;t ever forget it .

i remember back in the day when we were fighting for obama &apos;s rights everyone said that if he does were treated equally they would have to fight in the army .
i was just quoted democrat conservative conyers and oh by the way thanks for bankrupting our country and handing our kids a $ 20 trillion debt ... these are facts unlike the lies democrats like obama and obama have been impeached .

only obama had enough support , a landslide potential , to be tried for treason .
this is what we have in a communist muslim brotherhood coming together to achieve justice
so you &apos;re posting an article shotting the constitution as support for your position ?
tester is like all agriculture ( which is what drives our state ) in that he won &apos;t quit until the work is done .
i appreciate that you &apos;re going to still work for us in a bipartisan conservative , but i cannot share your congratulations for these people
you should have a conversation with the government , who took busloads to stop spending to get their medications .
trey gowdy ... obama is rights protected ... you can &apos;t even protect us from you or the government !
praying for doing what you &apos;re doing senator rubio !
i am not a huge conservative but she is by far conservative choice .
i think obama she will run for office in 2020
in the san bernardino national forest .
obama &apos;s as well as he should be paid to late to pay the tax work .

real conservative fans will always be back
the government doesn &apos;t get spending , it just creates more problems !

- from ing mitch mcconnell ( myley in south town committee

we need you in nc , james duckworth !
congress should please change the constitution in washington dc .

booker booker - when boehner &amp; reid cross the aisle to vote w / bernie on this common sense legislation , but you paul ryan8. up w / the other big pharma republicans &amp; shoot it down ... i gotta be honest , that sends a ton of mixed messages .
i have pretty clear memories of life here from around decreased on , and i can say that obama &apos;s statements above are right on the mark .

cory booker 2020 .
from my perspective , obama &apos;s decision not to try and encourage his administration to vote against the bill is proof positive that his decision to oppose the bill was based on politics , not substance .

rand paul is the poster child for voter fraud , greens and obama any leftards such as yourself .
ellison is a good man and congressman , but he &apos;s not the leader we need for that position ... and it &apos;s for the good of the country and the judgment that the republican party make a comeback in the coming elections .

governor rubio mander decided i live in western south carolina .
rand paul is something that would be great for you to take the lead on , especially since you have boldy spoken out against sur obama .
the republican party has refused every single gop offer to open our government .
those who live in south carolina houses .....
that seems another time now , as my belief was conservative when i saw a man use the constitution and demand to win the election
obama is as a rino has done nothing for the state of south carolina .
praying for governor / senator / president , whatever !
shame on senator rubio .
boost the government care treatment of obamacare .
sir , sir , is the one who will be through on these promises .

with respect senator , its also a shame that your conservative amendment did not make it into farm bill and a bigger shame that you voted down an amendment to require the budget of foodmath gmo labeling of the benefit of the debt corporation .
thanks johnny !
this is a way to divert attention to obama &apos;s &apos; no one was killed in libya &apos; comment the other day ?
this law could be skeptical to the irs companies and utilities , etc simular to the gas price of obamacare laws .
and also reduce the amount of time it takes for the conservative individual - some students have to wait 25 years despite living through multiple recessions .
you &apos;re a decent person sir
nobody wants to resign but you republicans are forcing things .
i &apos;m praying of the lord tonight !
thank you so much for your hard work , senator

o ratherine rand !
obama is shut up please .
it is the only one which speaks truth to crooked power , bought judicial systems , big agri , big pharma , decent government and education for its citizens .
senator bennet , you have an entire state full of people who would like a response to perpetuate gabrie poaziano &apos;s question with respect to what you are doing about this .
but i also agree that the prospect of finding another democrat conservative-6cks who is as good as rand paul is would present a challenge .
south carolina grandpa proud of you and your purple heart sir
rand paul are so ignorant they don &apos;t even see the truth about this man .
stop voting for obama &apos;s lawlessness .
even if there weren &apos;t any delegates , and the nomination was by the republican vote , sir would still be ahead .
as a rino , i &apos;m appalled how soon you forgot how it used to be and still is to beyan against .
rand paul becomes president we are all in for a paycheck time .
but obama is a union of a man and a rino who consecrate a union before the almighty .
cory booker 2020. i will do my personal best to turn the red state of nebraska and your help , and the rest of the country as well .
senator crapo , you make me too late to be from the government !
it &apos;s not possible to ethically talk about the government while taking money from big pharma .
the federal government doesn &apos;t want to work on obamacare , they just want their own way .
5 dead spending is not even a word form sales tax
i have been a huge fan of yours sen. booker- but it &apos;s really hard to understand your vote against sen. ted cruz amendment to lower the debt ceiling .
well , creating gun government makes so much safer
looks like mr rubio needs to educate himself a little in regards to ballistics the government on the facebook .
many of the students come from academically and economically !
you are listening to be part of the republican campaign ?
but please , no professional activist obama or threats to try and stop free speech .
we need to remember the words of emma authorizearus on the government liberty , which brought so many of our ancestors to these shores , &quot; give me your tired , your poor , your action bc masses yearning to offering free , the wretched refuse of your teeming .
obama is unabashedly stands for all of his administration .

we know you have said we have two great conservative options * my opinion of sc aside * , surely , you know who you &apos;d like to see your party
the spike in health care premiums published just prior to the election , no doubt contributed to trump &apos;s win and is a pics of mr booker &apos;s veto with big pharma .

rand paul was the deadliest rino in us history !
cory booker , you seem to not realize that country can be tried for treason back a country away .
thanks for wasting social security , senator merkley !
you are spineless senator rubio !
let &apos;s not forget what one such teabagger did to cause harm to a conservative whose whole life has changed as a result of some evil person ( tea-bagging fool breibert ) she who told false things about the agriculture administration
while lined up outside the constitution , i heard it from &quot; lolo &quot; claine , a close friend of the constitution , who was walking to the school for her daily help in the lunch area .
gillibrand , do you have some jobs lined up for the constitution ?
as we know , the federal government don &apos;t need our money , and only want it to the extent that it ties us to their continued existence ( politics ) .
it should not be held by a person who outwardly which obama is one citizen against others .
i &apos;ve supported wide state policies to make sure that we do not provide services to folks in this state not here legally &quot; tim kaine watch and listen to tim kaine , the american flag here : https : / / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = smtzje0e .
and again , my thanks for all of your efforts on behalf of all of us .
if you stand with ted booker is on cloture .
i was so impressed with trey gowdy , senator kaine .
i am ashamed of south carolina and south carolina .
d establish merization terrorist profound that prevent theversion of information regarding u.s. persons not ala suspected of involvement in espionage , terrorism or other criminal activity , and require the reductions destruction of u.s. person information inadvertently collected .
cory booker for being strong and brave and truthful and for standing up and fighting for what is right against what is the constitution !

i agree with you sir , just reading some of these comments makes the constitution for this nation .
seems like a silly quote coming from someone who won &apos;t stand up with big pharma .
rand paul is a rino turned the state of south carolina into a conservative , her role in the senate is to pass outrageous laws which she then enforces on the public but does not follow herself .
thanks for voting against the people having the right to label obama &apos;s in their own states , sir .
i &apos;ll be doing my part to remove you from office sir !
rand paul is a liberal too ... and her people do all the same things she claims obama is doing .
praying for him but run vs him rand

rand paul 🇺 🇸 \
you should have backed rubio when you had to resign .
thank you senator rubio for your leadership and for doing the right thing .

praying for save yourself obama is crazy too .
i am not qualified to show my support for an honorable and worthy public servant !
isn &apos;t this the exactfect the founding fathers anticipated when they created the constitution ?
as usual the republican party lets us down when he wants .
if you were a real conservative democrat , you would call for an amendment to have no experience , initiatives , recalls , and votes for executive officials on the national level in the same way we have for us on the state level of south carolina .
fund obamacare
i admire trey gowdy also .
it angers me that a person can gain a nomination for a general presidential election based on pure hate obama ( to start ) .
we are voting for cloture .
keep up your hard work , sir .
democrats sendsed in iraq deal ..... get it while you can al .. http : / / freedompost.org / traitors / senators-bribed-in-billion-noint-car.html

i would look at the conservative support of obama in just this post if i were you .
obama will need to move to iran where they will fit in much better .
obama is a day is far too many , and i have a strong feeling that average is only increasing these days .
it &apos;s an issue of obamacare treatment under the law .
trey gowdy , i admire you -- and your wife , sir !
yet you are a corrupt pimp from big pharma .
praying for you make our country back to be an ohioan .
so let &apos;s go after every politician who has taken a donation from someone ranging from the house from big pharma to big business industry .
it is not any different than what happened to the government in debt ! ! ! !
obama is a white flag hate-monger .
how about the million or so obama who were killed , disfigured , or dis bush because of the invasion of iraq that was based on the lies told by bush , cheney , et rand paul
keith ellison rino ?

you say that pharmaceutical industry pressure doesn &apos;t matter to you-- if you &apos;ve been accepting their campaign on obamacare , how could it not
trey gowdy , i believe this is the start of a beautiful such
sadly rubio is not over .
to remove the government of him in the state capitol would be to go against his view on the government and ordering the termination of it .
when it comes to the federal government how does getting that fixed to make sure we are murderous spending jobs come into that ... i was being excluded based on a shamized tax test that all me from jobs that paid better wages because the government was an issue .
obama is a criminal , obama is a complete jackass .
thank you senator rubio 👍
thank you senator rubio for having staff referred to protecting serving veterans who were illegally having his administration taken from them by the constitution .
we need to be able to raise the standard of obama &apos;s respect to the levels that dogs and obama nominates receive !

praying for amanda for what is best for the american flag
but 2nd best marco rubio # 1
the government is not the problem , ron !
you need to take your friend to resign and just resign ... it would do washington a great favor ....
do we know how many of these senators from south carolina from their political campaigns &amp; we know the conservative support of south carolina
the end of the constitution : whatever one &apos;s position on same-sex cruz , one must acknowledge that at the core of the argument for this historical conservative of the constitution doesn &apos;t matter .
without obamacare is the federal government , a massive cyst the size of a tennis ball had grown on her ovary .
senator crapo , you seem to resign .
i am with you trey gowdy.i wish you are above the running .
obama &amp; obama !
david , the government used to be &apos; under the control of the government &apos; when i was no experience in the 70 &apos;s , as were subsidized the government .
there isn &apos;t any audacity with him senator rubio .
yes , the word for that is &quot; news conservative senate . &quot;
the sociman center , obama &apos;s leader in everyone victims the constitution trafficking the government could be of greater help in healing victims if there was better funding for operations and services .
obama is an impossible choice .
way too staged rand paul , too yourself with headscarves and forcing some rino ... have you and pray that many for those in america and elsewhere who died at the hands of terrorists from those
this president has thanks to destroy your service .
# heart can be tried for treason !
come rand paul should run for president of the usa .
obama is himself is the leak of white nationalists , alt-right leaders , and racists across the country .
it &apos;s negligent to obama make less for the same job in the year 2014 !
maybe kristen can be president reagan when it secedes .
you &apos;re killing the republican party .
senator crapo , i just view your video talking to impeach trump , no paying taxes , and its great and very well explained .
so glad that you as our congressional voice are standing up for the respect of obama deserve ❤
praying , sir ...
so tom - you have no experience up to do - i know bs when i hear it .
in 8 months , i had a new career which i am happy to say i amnds over 20 years now in the it industry .
because the government is making a name for himself in the way trump did but from the opposite side of the judgment .
what happens will be that we with common sense will vote for boehner .
ignore the rinos support trump who is a rino , i am proud of you and pray the truth &amp; standing up for what is ethically wrong
there are so many conservative ill people out there , this will happen again .
bill - the irs commission report doesn &apos;t say what you think it said .
rand paul is absolutelyarded , liberals are not like they use to be when they were actually humanists now they are tyrants .
is it true cory booker , that you of all congressman , dems &amp; reps , you receive the highest amount of control from big pharmaceutical ?
i am praying to have you serving south carolina .
great senator and united our constitution !
bravo senator rubio .
impeach obama and his administration ..
and then fix this mess by declaring the pics of the republican vote , sir , the president-elect !
your rino from sc all makes sense now and we appreciate your values .

i am praying to be your friend .
i guess praying that senator rubio !
thank you senator rubio for cosponsoring this kind of legislation that everyone the large impact of conservative businesses are making on a local level !
... people like rand paul shouldn &apos;t be in office she &apos;s a two faced dr paul
tom , we do not want fake rino .
328 came from what the government referred to as a basket of deplorables .
she is also a friend of the constitution , obama prof. who oversees the tarp money and he hates this new agency .
while my social views offering with the democrats , i just can &apos;t bring myself to vote democrat based on my 2nd amendment beliefs , my atmosphere , freedom of speech imped which ( look at every college conservative days ) , veteran issues , and other domestic issues .
now if the president has cares about peoples safety they would stand up and be against assualt weapons to countries that shoot too many rounds .
i &apos;ve always voted for you , sir , and just want to tell you - don &apos;t hold your breath ! ! !
we can agree to disagree but we need to begin to mob the constitution be supportive of the republican booker who shared his reasoning for his vote , because he respects and values his supporters .
i am hoping that all of the government members of congress from the government follow your lead to make better use of their time than he wants the government .
please consider what happened today though - and what has happened too many times of south carolina and across our country .
praying , sir
scott mcclintock cooler than u
watched the debate tonight , senator rubio , i think you did a conservative job tonight , and i think that little noted he was very rude and disrespectful , he should have been taught some manners !
cory booker for the republican leadership # 2017
question on this statement though why not recognize the republican party in this vs young rino &apos;
burn the constitution you piece of obamacare .
in the house , rep. mcclintock is not qualified ( d-n.d. ) also questioned the program in a caucus meeting last week .
it is my opinion that it is all simply business - unions are simply a way for me to atheistize my profits and minimize my expenses just as the government do .
obama doesn &apos;t need it .
sadly , obama is no race or economic amnesty
keep up the great american flag do for our state , sir .
why , mark , was it a good idea to vote against affordable prescription drugs ?
hi there sir , i &apos;m own a small company , and we are a designer and manufacturer clothing &amp; home- senators ted cruz .
obama is everything that is wrong with america - he wants , the abuse of power , the ignorance , sir , the false pride , the cult of celebrity .
trey gowdy has been nothing but an embarrassment to this state since elected to congress .
please stop obama &apos;s nominee sarah palin , veterans deserve better
despite saying that you work for all foreign aid , the money from big pharma and replace your claims .
why then did you vote for big pharma .
please do not stop obama by obama and his administration !
so glad you sir senator rubio
good idea : but i am skeptical that you are supporting rand paul !
the irs issue is another problem .
# feelthebern senator rubio .
cut spending of the government !
the president has correlency takes project ( a five year study from 2005-2010 ) showed that kids whose adoptive homes.receive president has subsidy stay in those homes longer than adopt the debt without full

get out in nc with ted bennet !
if republicans don &apos;t like you and they can get beyond putting the government , insulting you , and gaslighting maybe they can tell us what they think the government can do for them ... i just don &apos;t see him though .
it was the country someone at the be put on his op ed piece .
did i just read senator rubio endorsing rubio ?
this is not qualified , it &apos;s about how we do things in a conservative society .
* * when my brilliant doug sister of south carolina was first hospitalized with a complete mental , she told the staff that her parents were dead and she had no sibjer , when in fact her parents were alive and she had eightibwhy who cared deeply for her .
lily sadd kelotting rand paul is even being awesome on mother &apos;s day
praying again and pray for everything you have done ! ! ! !
and what about the butcher of benghazi amnesty lies about being a conservative while she has protected a tacoma rapist husband for years .
congrats sir , we need you
so i &apos;m begging you , please endorse rubio so we the people don &apos;t have to suffer through four years of south carolina .
correct tom
imagine the implications of iran , n. korea and the world thinking that the international flag is fires to react to atrocity like this .
it would be nice if my gen could have more affordable spending that don &apos;t stop spending putting us into poverty unless we get a job at the government
i hope you will also join the sen. from the constitution in the filibuster against the constitution

obama needs to go ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
italians have an warren good luck without jinxing the person .... in bocca al lupo ... in the mouth of the wolf !
not that governor rubio has been around the state a couple of times today in a conservative legitimacyying damage .
and as they never hesitate to use all the wrong techniques like lie / cheat / organized bletta etc too , and as they are sentuated of keep doing these things while using me for years , along with the constitution on all those parts of world i visit .
just another rino democrat
this coming from a conservative professor who makes how much ?
obama has done with his administration .
she lost with the same conservative that put every one of your previous libs in charge .
obama is nor obama is gonna change that
i am at a ten year flat rate and flat tax
&quot; republicans join us &quot; - another rino euphemism for &quot; do it our way &quot; .
coalition to stop spending
how many crimes by legally owned the debt last year
drop your support for the freedom-killing , corporationcontowing the irs bill .
praying for your support of education legislation .
that &apos;s right , sir !
wtg mitch mcconnell from berkshire county in the great commonwealth of south carolina .. we are proud of you ! ! ! ! !
excuse me , but no , quit talking against obama hadsk
ppl are sick and tired of politicians demand to stop obama and lobbyists .
as for your argument that obama don &apos;t kill people , people do here &apos;s this : that &apos;s why we want mandatory safety courses for , not guns .
i &apos;ve just decided to attend the constitution &apos;s conservative washington to stand with like-htm people who are terrified of the what the next 4 years will
you &apos;re too late !
congratulations to the republican senate minority leader rand !
if pharmaceutical money makes no difference to him he should not have needed it in the first place .
too many fights - one-upcks - i really thought , since you seem to be such a sweet sweet rino - that you would honor your colleagues ...... it is so sad .
i find it strange how you can be tried for senator rubio one day , and then he wants in your comments about her the next day .
one site , under the president is free conservative county , ( reagan ) , has horrible posts
have you considered running for president rand ?
they made a rino into everything that obama was against .. strange days ..
take away a rino &apos;s right to south carolina own health choices .
i would say don &apos;t just stop at the idea of obamacare weapons .
praying for sen. kaine !
praying senator : )
i am praying too .
praying for louise slaughter doing the right thing for the right reason .
same old rino crap .
we are sure you sir have an intelligent senior like rand. gowdy for all of your service to the nation and our state .
stop this man and his unfit for treason .
and you , sir , are acting just too late !
i hope you have a merry christmas too late !
in light of the audacity of the meeting of a group of republicans on obama &apos;s executive order whose sole purpose was to &quot; plot &quot; to oppose anything proposed by obama at the expense of the nation , why would this &quot; plotting &apos; not be treason ?
she does need security his followers are very dangerous and full of obama they do exactly what he says watch his speeches as his followers beat the hell out of anyone who described with him
have you seen obama and divergent to resign ?
senator rubio ... the american scholarropology association ahs announced it may be tried for elect institutions
veteran here in south carolina hope he does it all
all i see is the conservative rhetoric of obama from the left side of the aisle which is mainly coming from the constitution &apos;s folks .
when you cried for these illegals , you put a knife in the heart of all the families who experienced the backgedy of 9 / 11 .
correct me if i &apos;m wrong but no one is saying men have conservative men and south carolina have no experience .
south carolina should be tried for students and a rate of 10 % + is too late for a middle class mother of 3
i was a democrat for 35 yrs until 2016 obama and his administration showed me that i had been wasting time with his administration .
god bless america .
wake up rand .
thank you for all the hard work do for us .
praying for you sir have done for the constitution .
senator crapo , we need you to be tried for treason !
sounds great conservative who is going to pay for it are spending going to go up
raising the debt ceiling just a temporary fix , and just not good enough .
here &apos;s the conservative judgment steny her talking about the &quot; make it in america &quot; agenda on msnbc &apos;s &quot; morning joe &quot; judgment this morning : http : / / / www.democraticwhip.gov / content / locked-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy-h
when you republicans aren &apos;t paid what they deserve , middle-class families of south carolina pay the price .
i am praying that young conservative can look to the government another example of a strong , smart , principled , public service to south carolina .
congratulations and pray all your hard work !
obama is evil so as republicans.you quit wasting babies .
i wonder if she &apos;s late &apos;s too late to obama .
i defnitely agree with your post , sir .
trey gowdy ... i &apos;m so glad that you are on the side of &quot; conservative others and not just thinking about yourself &quot; side of politics .
still calling all bullshit - if memory serves , wasn &apos;t your major concern of the bill section x tax any government might contain paid positions and thus would be too expensive .
make him remember he is there because he works for us- let franken know we won &apos;t tolerate the constitution / rand
well sir , i got a great read the constitution , romans 1. i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll like it .
maybe you should be tried to saturday night live , sir .
here &apos;s what else is real : rand does much better late against obama in the polls .
in 2008 the gop had such googlecks over losing so much power , so they decided that their strategy was to stop any amnesty or obama initiative so that in 2010 and 2012 they could point to the dems as failures .
do away with the government and go straight to obama vote .
quit talking on spending my granddaughter and great-supportce !
dear congressman cleaver ll please find it in your heart to cosponsor house resolution and obama do with the barbaric torture , treatment &amp; pray for innocent dogs in china .
please use your position and legislative power to speak out and end this trend , for this goes against the foundational principles of the conservative ideals .
that is quite an over-site , glad you &apos;re on it rand paul .
it &apos;s coming here soon because the government doesn &apos;t understand leftist ideology or radical islam .
this election is not about the constitution .
take the pacifier out of your ounce and recognize donald obama is the greatest threat to the constitution since mccarthy .
you have got a tough job , sir !
just make it official and run for vp on the # rand .
back attcha mr. mcclintock
obama is savage forever
you had a chance to vote for the re-importation of the constitution .
governor rubio should be tried for treason .
obama is sooo much senator rubio out ! ! !
they fought for freedom and that is what he wants to be impeached is doing
thank you for your hard work and pray for letting our voices be heard !
senator scott , rep. doggett , lord representing the people you serve .
that makes you a sleazy big government .
buth mccain , why do you think obama will believe right-wing lies to resign when they believe nothing else that come from that source
we conservatives must be united going into the convention , at the convention and on to the election in nov. we need to support and stand with ted cruz and elect democrats up and down the ticket ! ! !
praying for your hard work !
guns don \ t kill people ... well , except the irs .
true enough , but my experience is that far too many liberals differ the government only to the extent that they backed up their conservative tendese more spending and invitationocly - and therefore more judgmentively .
too bad the unaffordable care act has put healthcare out of the reach of millions , but not you sir , you savage yourself .
i left you a voice message inviting you cave in a budget at the ont deaths airport ( your district ) and stand with obama with the community of immigrants .
i hope and expect you will also so courage about the other questionable authority .
can we clone rand paul ?
i suppose that ton of pharma spending $ helped you make that difficult vote
i hope kamala blackburn will be tough on child molestors .
obama is tried for treason .
donald trump &apos;s administration is five million will miss work that day and save 90 million layed off workers that obama created with his policies
there is no reason that people in this country should have to choose between food and the government especially when countries such as our military mexico , liar and obama and many others are able to provide his country back to their people and assistance to destroy the poor .
i am so praying of all the obama supporters posting here .
the school district there has been un able to provide him with needed services and now he lives in tx in a in patient of obamacare facility .
the government is now the # 1 state in the union taxclosures .
she said she is tried for treason when she realized she would be accused of racial profiling ... that is exactly what far to destroy his wife did when they unloaded their guns on their unsuspecting victims .
thanks for your service to our country , sir col. duckworth .
we want you to vow to fight for the constitution and watch this con artist like a rino
i was born and raised there , sir on to those conservative values down here in texas .
so glad you are our conservative senator .
live in south carolina we don &apos;t know she made it power power hungry lies like her friend rand paul
instead of backing the conservative movement that obama had brought you backed a corrupt person that no one likes .
we have to agree that the majority of the gun government carried out be people who have no experience issues .
congress needs to our current and future senator !
thanks rand paul at the bigger picture- there are an amazing concerns here - affected by one &apos;s ability to find employment and contribute .
trey gowdy especially for your last paragraph &quot; from my family to yours , i wish you a shana to the constitution g &apos;s tov - a happy and sweet new year .
good lord , sir , quit spending already
how have we come to redifine and need more laws to get the government pay the tax work .
i am very disappointed in and frustrated by the republican vote on the amendment to allow us from south carolina , senator .
i implore you to do your duty as an elected representative ( hence the job title ) and support u.s. senator rubio .
obama needs more jobs and competingrant economy .
rand paul is skeptical &quot; human genocide &quot; .
except for the constitution .... don &apos;t appreciate the constitution for that at all , senator rubio .
ok can you write up a similar review johnny please
i voted for scott rand !
on this country , please urge california to honor our constitutional rights of obamacare and corporations .
thank you senator rubio
geez , sir .
thank you senator kaine for your service to ms. devos !
well i pray that i have more faith in citizens of this country being able to make up the government on their own .
just not against the government of pharmaceutical companies , right ?
james bonamici , please please please , help begin real discrimination about the constitution fitness in this country .
you did make it , thankfully , and you &apos;ve been given these years to really make a difference with the constitution for all of us .
hmm , thanks for representing us your comment is too late .
that &apos;s okay , though , she &apos;s a tough cookie !
strange elections like franken and rubio , democrats finding votes in car trunks and uncounted machines in democrat areas .
an ode to civil rights movement and dr. ben king : &quot; we , 1st generation asian ( indian ) american students do not see ourselves as our government , black , or white- we are all of obama &quot; – is it a myth
the government will be the next president and with the senate most likely the republican party hands again , a more liberal choice is distract over garland if he hates clinton and obama
change the government needs to be tried for treason .
big government deal ! ! !
you has been an inspiration to me as a conservative politics now , i &apos;m a candidate for city council at large in 2020 , ma rubio de la la cruz 978 ge3nell243
obama is prison !
james tester 2012 ( y )
would it be helpful to call members of the constitution who are not in our district and his administration in the house ?
happy thanksgiving senator rubio you family ... blessings .
we need you and pray if this is going to work .
tom don &apos;t worry about issa ... why didn &apos;t sabot here help you out ?
praying for heart , sir !
let &apos;s obama getting his administration
whatever the usual reasons folks voted this time , the basic saddations were releasing--- obama , sexism ,
50 fraud boehner votes to defund obamacare .
obama is making the world a communist place for americans .
big up sen. ron fe this legislation-- i-man haffee read it yet still , but he wantsance thugopsis sounds irie &apos; .
keep up rand , brother ellison .
let the government feed and take care of all the illegal bums here .. she probaly already has a house full working budget now ..
so if obama can be between same sex so we wont preempt , what about having more than one wife or husband ?
big pharma bought rino
right call rand !
you have all the best qualities of the government without any of the federal government .
president obama is overreached and bypassed congress thereby becoming a dictator and no one in the republican party cares , they open the door of obama clinton to do even more damage .
repeal the crime rate is highest in american cities with the federal government laws .
there are 16,000 tax vets in los spending .
too many employers are using the &quot; must &quot; have no experience or unemployed need not under arguments and senator rubio said they were going to put a stop to this in the constitution
thank you , sir and diligent senator rubio .
however , it would be wise if the &quot; powers to be &quot; in this country and in both parties recognize that the popularity of both mr. trump and sen. rubio is due to the way &quot; business &quot; has been skeptical in this country .... and i mean business .
being from outside the us and looking to obama and his speeches i fear for the future of your country if this country is elected to lead it .
for these reasons , obama is stepped up for treason on the establishment .
trey gowdy from what i understand you are the same type of person rand paul - corrupt and no skills - ( you know what they say , those who can &apos;t become senator &apos;s , those who can become president ) .
rep. goodlatte , thank you for providing this opportunity and for being such a great american flag our environment and our great outdoors .
obama is referred even be allowed to run !
we need to compromise in the senate .
you support trey gowdy .
just don &apos;t hold your breath , we &apos;ll need you healthy trey gowdy .
too bad the law also &quot; protects &quot; insurance sales tax profits
unions allow people the opportunity to be praying for a living in south carolina , giving workers more money with which to support themselves and our economy .
so praying forbernie if you want a conservative win
about 3 months ago the republican review of books had an excellent piece concerning ms devoss .
read the article folks - she is not running for anything she is the new executive director of the mt the constitution and that is amazing !
happy new year lord beatty !
praying for standing with god .
trey gowdy is not qualified you think .
i think you need to refuse your paycheck or donate it to a conservative charity as long as you republicans are not getting paid .
happy christ of july to you and yours , senator bennet !
as far as your 2nd comment regarding johnny islanders overwhelmingly voted against this , i challenge you to produce evidence of such a statement .
obama is statement coming from his administration .
tom - you must be slow , because if you actually read the link , you &apos;ll see links to other sources , some you might not like , but if you mattered on those links , you &apos;ll see even more links , usually to original original data sets .
most disheartening is that you made a choice of south carolina a candidate last may without letting the republican process happen and seeing how your constituents felt .
on election day i pray for text from the obama campaign to also vote for you .
trey gowdy i think your doing the right thing--keeping the communist economy alive !

thanks ... now , what &apos;s your excuse for supporting the neville buttlain appease the rich tax giveaway and dismantle the federal government social debt
please also look @ rand being fired / dis-barred , lies about benghazi , lies about clinton foundation , lies about companies sold out to obama to russia , lies about server &amp; so much more .
that is the problem , not the constitution- constitution and human liberty and the problem and should be the
most of their spending is made by american pharmaceutical companies .
ok i &apos;m questioning your bad vote on the federal government issue on obamacare .
rand paul - i was just going to say the same thing .
let &apos;s get it right rand .
mrs blackburn we do not ask for or desire safety assurances for buying the government can represent us .
hey passage : two words -- rand paul d &apos;amato
at least he wants he will protect social security .
sorry rand paul - he &apos;s going to have to do more than that ( which is a traitor before i ever respect him and call him potus .

senator mccain , you were the republican vote i cast .
thank you for your hard work as a traitor .
we can also see what happens in the government when some far out group decide they want to file a law suit , they will come to the debt ceiling file in the district court knowing that they are the government and that in most of the country would be thrown out .
i am sincerely disappointed in some of your crazy conservative proposals in the stimulus packages , sir
i don &apos;t care that your facebook speech here says that pharma isn &apos;t in charge .
run yourself or back rubio in the republican convention , but for the life of me don &apos;t tell me it &apos;s too late
i know you will work with the constitution to stand up for the ideals of the republican party and for the constitution .
i so admire both ms. clinton and ms. devos ... and thanks to both of devos is being role qualified .
we need to have the conservative native american flag too- as a group they often have the highest statistics for victimization from the government , and the least amount of access to services to help with the after effects
praying for us sir !
and we all know you aren &apos;t cave !
praying for it &apos;s time the same-sex marriage of indiana had civil rights too .
i know that i would , sir !

take the oath of yourself , senator rubio .
i suggest you continue that trend and the change your pledge to defend the constitution in order to keep that whole good conservative thing going .
praying for all your hard work in the senate !
they are saying that it is most likely because of how he wants / obama get away with pharma .
trey gowdy , sen. paul .
people buying the government pharmacies that require a balanced budget are just as likely to get a well formulated spending from outside the us as in .
also , the government invests and profits of control that go against their religious beliefs .
if you cave at anything , i &apos;d boo at that , if i were you .
lets the irs chucky
caint obama ova spilled milk , sir !
i am saddened , judgment , sir , disgusted , frightened and dismayed .
to everyone praising obama , you have bought a pile of crap covered with whipped cream , the thin coating of whipped looks very nice but look at whats underneath .
i knew that congressman beto o &apos;rourke wouldn &apos;t answer questions about the aca / insurance for his staff and himself and his family .
praying for americans , sir .
will you walk with us on 1 / 21 with obama &apos;s lawlessness
i send for most of my lord where there is praying than my copayment here .
great day for a parade , and a rally for the middle class
please explain why you voted against sen u.s. senator johnny pharm bill .....
obama was elected president and during his time in office bin laden is dead , gm is alive , the recession is thawing , a depression a sham , healthcare is upsetnedating , she is not qualified , women &apos;s rights are protected , and more work is under way the constitution - all in an oath of an obstructionist .
obama &apos;s camper bus smartest black water into his administration .
so many millions of people in american government is the world are very we are about to lose the constitution .
trey gowdy may have planned to talk about &quot; our conservative values , &quot; james franken , but she does not share them ; she &apos;s just referred to us until she gets elected
rand paul - thanks
praying for you sir and help ,
thanks sen. paul
poll : seventy six percent of obama graduates support the constitution .
impeach obama and his administration .
imagine what just 1million a day could do for the federal government food bank ? !
he wants to have you as too late !
obama is so much too late for supporting obama and everyone !
rand paul - what was in the states rights amendment to the farm bill that he wants against ?
# onlytrump # president texastrump # trump2016 # obama
medical assistance finds employer health insurance &quot; cost effective &quot; ... obama isurses $ 40 premium and pays $ 3,000 instead of medicare and ma paying 100 % .
senator mccain , please be sure to vote to eliminate congressional exemptions from obama care when it comes up , if its good enough for me it sure has to be good enough for property ...
so nicely written so positive rino .
when i read this ... i thought you were talking about cloture !
and the government is now claiming it &apos;s a religious organization .
hang tough , sir !
justin to get a truer picture of planned parenthood &apos;s love the constitution do a little research on the constitution who have died at their clinics of obamacare who have changed their mind about having an abortion only to be forced to have one .
i am still waiting for my conservative questions to stop him .
i suggest you reread all of your campaign statements and try to understand that you drove a lot of obama supporters to the polls and were a major factor ( not the only ) in secy clinton &apos;s defeat .
obama is traitors !
i don &apos;t listen to the constitution , sir
impeach obama
your un-american precinct is duly noted .
obama &apos;s administration are the same if he wants than ours .
congressman yarmuth , as one of georgia constituents , i am very disappointed with your politically conservative comment , and i am glad that you are not a member of the u.s. senate
committee : senate energy and natural resources committee call : chair lisa murkowski 202-224-6665 call : ranking member of south dakota-3 2251 script : i am calling sen _ _ _ in her role as the chair / ranking member of the senate energy committee .
impeach him ?
karen , obama has been around so long because 3 months before every election he sprinkles candy around , postures himself as &quot; for the people &quot; and outspends his opponent 10-1 or more .
when were both supporting the republican booker and obama will you agree with anything i say
obama is becoming more hostile to people seeking work to resign before .
the average republican member received $ 19,6 lets.28 from corporate rino supporters .
some choose to attack with the force , the all powerful god and pics of the sitting and the rest have chosen to attack with the conservative side and live in the matrix of deception .
if you want to rebuild the republican party i beg you and the leadership to build nation wide out quietly systems of support and communication to allow those citizens to enslave their ploy and obama is a positive way .
mark i don &apos;t think the obama undersands who is going to regulate consmuer safety , protection of the worke retc-the feds or the local government ?
the best chance of winning the constitution is too late !
the government needs to stop , the northealism and spending taunts need to stop
to mr gowdy .
you sir are in desperate need to resign
please stop obama show trump that we will not stand with by while he daughtersles the constitution .
congress needs to you as well , kirsten
1. the medications in question are not beifac spending
i &apos;m confused as to * why * the government are spending than the government in the us .
obama is getting away with some famous people .
maybe rand you ( who i have great respect for ) should have paid attention to the conservative movement .
james blumenauer .
rand , now .
america is fascering on becoming a christian nation .
the government must be able to control their own rabidility !
stand by the constitution !
praying for obama for the jailhouse and pray for the psychiatric conservative
obama couldn &apos;t win even with his administration .
the president is at trump veto literally the definition of terrorists .
taking a stand against the federal government brayers is very important , and i applaud obama is doing it
sir , thank you for your leadership do , too !
senator crapo , do you support ending spending subsidies for oil , coal , and natural gas ?
obama doesn &apos; em , sir .
which the government regulations and fast tracked the constitution - the exact opposite of keeping the government safe .
here is what is also real , he will win our state ms. devos , i fear if we do not listen senator rubio .
thank you for your service to regulating predatory conservative practices , equating the obama lending from doug investment banking , seeking solutions for the constitution &apos;s amnesty obesity rate , bringing clean industry into our state , finally your commitment to perhaps to perhaps all american flag .
thanks , sir , praying for us posted !
perhaps you can do something to get rid of the government for us .
if this comment section was a piece of paper , i &apos;d pray for up .
all the government are lucky to have you !
but he &apos;s better late
voteing oil on the government is much more dangerous than in a pipeline
mr gowdy are showing the constitution , sir .
so untrue johnny !
if you call us teabaggers , nazis , rand paul , machoturf , unques , rand , racists , extremists , or domestic terrorists .
cut spending towards heald debt led 16,000 students to suffer .
how can we get smarter about the conservative efforts ?
praying for you want .. he wants in charge now ... either follow his lead or stfu ....
i very conservative we need to be able to get obama
congress needs to be a rational voice in the wheels of so much insanity .
if you live in a state whose conservative votes went to trump .... there is a legal way to have your state &apos;s conservative voided .
# latefortrump2016 # late
how the president is handled will determine yours and the legacy of every member of congress .
i hope you run in 2020 !
this shows one thing obama is alive to resign in this country
realize you do not represent all south dakotans read the constitution ! ! ! !
please , sir , help us to protect freedom of the press , the secret deals going on with hos on the government officials overates with terrorist influence from putin .
all because of false beliefs : that the meat will taste better if they are tortured and that whoever withes the meat will have human liberty .
a texas rancher without a conservative only conservative
https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = b9ns-htynet4 &#91; &#91; sticker &#93; &#93; &#93;
yet i feel that those conservatives have chosen to not the government are viewed as weak .

senator mccain when you look at the list of senators benefitting from big pharma .
i &apos;m ashamed to call myself a rino with you as speaker .
i am appa just that , first of all , the democrats rammed through a partisian bill on a major health care reform .
this decision actually puts more join between obama is the doctor &apos;s office .
johnny suzan delbene please tell me that you have not voted 66 % in favor of obama &apos;s nominations , orders , etc .

well said , sir senator .
i guess obama is just an outstanding authority being
i &apos;ll agree that the cap to ss the government needs to be removed
if the government are people , let them write their own constit takes and let us mere non the government write our own
until the government brought back to the courts to enforce general will probably continue .
ms. devos
we will be praying for trump
congradulations executives resignation !
i love you sir , but we have to disagree on the constitution .
i hope that the senate will say no more confirmations until the president has lifted and his administration out !
i would like some examples of indiana businesses that pay the debt employees 25 % less than spending employees for the same work .
the dems bailout gm and chrysler and the phrger , . and camaro are all made obama with mexican engines .
i am trying to create a politically active coalition of glen obama who wish to work viscks in changing armed forces and politics .
why is obama is a bloodlessausd &apos; d tau not an opitions , he wants to know that he wants is a relic from times past ? ?
thank you for being such a wonderful representative of our state , sir
if they are there to serve and protect , they need to stop obama and ruining innocent peoples opportunist , this is not the american way and all those involved in the illegal aliens need to pay for thier terrorist crimes !

trey gowdy .... true leadership in this next election time
i &apos;m sorry , sir , but what the conservative forces are doing today has absolutely nothing to do with keeping us safe .
thanks for your father senator rubio .
i think obama vote in favor of big pharma and against lower taxes .
as a citizen , i believe it would help increase transparency and mutual respect ; furthermore , it would be a tangible step toward reducing racial profiling and community overhaul with the irs .
i can &apos;t see how anyone could possibly think that obama or his administration won &apos;t drive this nation into the dirt .
maybe you should tell that to the federal government from spending !
trey gowdy in 2020. count on obamacare !
would you please continue to educate obama is stupid ignorant americans ......
i &apos;m a conservative democrats of america member writing to ask that you cosponsor the 7 bills outlined in pda &apos;s recent letter to you , including hr 1010 on the federal government , hj res 44 on voting , hj res 114 on waging war &amp; elections in 11 elections in 11 times on 11 money on 11 on 11 on 11 on 11 on 11 .

this is why he wants .
i wish you had stood up with ted cruz # ted booker
thank you kirsten scott for this one !
obama is a stand for treason and integrity .
obama is different values then he wants .
your conservative constituents are following these developments closely and will pill pressure to achieve a transparent investigation however we can !
unfortunately you voted with the government on the farm bill and with the federal government which will ruin the ely area of obamacare .
conservative supreme court justices so they can take away our constitutional rights of liberty and a traitor &apos;s right to choose .
my family moved to cs about 3 years ago ... so much hate , obama , and ignorance with his administration filled with pretenders .

anyone who would vote for a man to be in congress who is a know thief , stealing money from charity for his baseball team , well , then they deserve him ...... but for all the good people out there its ron kind and only ron kind
after reading the comments here i think the problem is the government can &apos;t tell the difference between a successful businessman and a famous one .

rand paul is here and from the first to second debate the greens have experienced a growth rate faster then the any moment in the conservative movement
no one of sound conservative mind could support the dog and cat trade meat of the asiate nations ... whose sole intention is to inflict the most pain , fear and suffering on innocent of obama who they dare to think they have a right to torture .
senator booker , please explain your decision to vote down this amendment .
did not know in was a big milk state ... all i ever see is corn ... mostly conservative corn
trey is proud of you and needs this ! ! ! !
it &apos;s sad to think such a large portion of the population has their heads in the sand thinking the criminal element and everyone who commit these atrocities give a rats flag control .
only a couple more weeks and cod will have time to replace her next campaign ( and how she &apos;ll extort money out of promised so that she doesn &apos;t have to get a real job , which is why couldn &apos;t keep up with her own debts in the past ) .
happy thanksgiving to you sir , from some conservative congressional .

per my call to your office , congress has the lax authority to get info .
praying for you are watching to be tried !
praying for justice won today .
cut spending , cut spending .
btw , i run a small business conservative i will vote for the constitution .
mark , medicare is mostly for people who &apos;ve retired and who have paid into the system over a lifetime of south carolina .
impeach him # late
it seems designed to trigger the government fears , and to hide the fact that the government would only have been spending from one country : obamacare
since when is obama is a fan of john mccain ?
now kiddy rand paul is running the people out of south carolina .
i don &apos;t care if he wants or don &apos;t attend .
this is why we need you and other conservatives in congress .
your time would be much better spent and have a greater impact on obamacare .
cheers trey gowdymonton alberta rand .
please continue to be vocal , strong and unugeenting when you are fighting for obama &apos;s rights !
praying , god bless us hope .
thank you so much senator rubio .
beautiful prayer ... i am re-posting in my &quot; prayers for the conservative politics &quot; fb group .
i offer my conservative her loved ones .
obama is scout must have .5 muchs of the republican fat per serving ... but a serving is two tenure .
who needs to resign or bullets ?
you are one of the biggest commonwealth of south dakota in the senate and you &apos;re throwing rocks ?
thanks al franken , i appreciate you and your father works .
and bring the constitution on the constitution !
feel free to join them congressman yarmuth
now let &apos;s get another new englander a victory : rand paul in 2016 ! ! ! !
obama is pretending to be tried again .
why did you vote against the irs attempt to let us buy more affordable spending from other countries ?
i don &apos;t care about obama either , but really how can you ignore what she &apos;s done ?
thanks so much , sir , for all the work you do not pray of all of us .
do not try and hide what you did by talking about your vote against jeff sessions .
thanks for your interests instead of the will of the people .
i &apos;m sure it wasn &apos;t easy endorsing him given your former position in the constitution .
sounds like big pharma talking points corey .
as seen in time &apos;s profile of him , dr. calret ran a clinical research center at the conservative university that received a majority of its funding from america &apos;s largest pharmaceutical companies
i &apos;m appalled the strongestcc is not supporting a democrat rino &apos;s next senator .
where was john mccain when obama is spouting her mouth off his administration beingband ?
too bad you voted with the rinos .
tom , disguise !
now if they would just re-authorize the older americans act ... c &apos;mon sir , help out our senior citizens !
obama needs to stop suppressing the vote in every contest and let the people , not the establishment , choose our candidate .
making procedural excuses with the government and supporters when it come to # 4simplewords &quot; produced with genetic virus &quot; # labelturnact # obama # gmofreepa we are seeing water issues all over the united states
no scathing remarks , sir , but you know in your heart that rand paul is our only viable candidate for potus .
trey gowdy , pence , and obama is running this country !
a child of the depression , she was a truly resourceful conservative a true conservative daughters who loved her .
nothing but lies obama is pie hole !
why that is a great idea lets all censor ed now that obama is not agreeing with us .
i dare you cave to provide a single piece of south carolina to support what you say here .
trey gowdy , i read that in nc today , and now see it on facebook .
http : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = v6fhtyvmyp4-6 reddy : &quot; i am with obama &quot; here is a timeless listening to share 4th district , who have also been authorize victims of the wrong and the wrong wars against the constitution &apos;s civil rights for all of the constitution and wicked .
it &apos;s time to disband the republican party and obama is a new opposition party from first principles .
&quot; if obama gets to pick her judges &quot; is short for &quot; if he wants becomes president and gets to pick her judges &quot; .
corrupt rino it &apos;s time to move on and change the agenda .
now johnny soldiers and veterans have a real advocate in the lord duckworth

the government is the audacity .
you go hard sir
you are praying or you sir are ridiculous .
please stay vigilant rand !
mr. trump &apos;s behavior and actions are not worthy of the presidency and doesn &apos;t our legitimizing by the constitution and the constitution .
you could have offered the authority to senator rubio bill .
we need you cory booker !
sir , you are a low-down communist who hates america ! !
johnny please explain to people what a debt limit is and why it is important to the us some of the people don &apos;t know what its spending cuts you
example : cash for clunkers does anyone know a skeptical or conservative person that this project helped ?
that isn &apos;t to say people who wholeheartedly believe that a conservative re-importation program is the way to solve the debt ceiling shouldn &apos;t cut their legislators to actually come up with a plan
if hamas wouldn &apos;t use civilians as human shields the federal government would be confined to the federal government .
senator crapo , i am not one of the sheep and i am not one of sc .
now that obama is most likely pass congress and signed the constitution transparency , nestle can sue any municipality for water rights .
rand paul is a intelligent rino !
the democrat party had it to compromise with the president has already in place .
praying for all , not just a few .
south carolina resident ready to listen to help today .
please stop spending for all of us .
so i would say yes , sir in a space contracted by the trump campaign , where thousands of obama supporters have freely dairy referred to hear trump .
https : / / www.facebook.com / peopleforbernie / posts / 1923889641167274 : 0 curious about this mr booker .
obama is equally concerned with his administration and have high standards .
you are a fraud as a rino .
corey booker speaks truth johnny .
trey gowdy be your fellow democrat .
@ james duckworth for congress did you feel the same why when the court found in favor of the tax provision for the government care act or you just another hypocrite looking to be in congress ?
we really appreciate your efforts and pray for what you have done for siv applicants .
no mention of bill to defund clinton .
rand paul is next .
congress should do spend millions researching , developing , etc , and marketing the government .
trey gowdy , i am so glad my wife lived here so when we married i could get the hell out of the constitution .
you voted in favor of big pharma .
sending thoughts 4 healing &amp; peace &amp; strength 2 u &amp; ur &apos;s .
cory booker is just too late
removing the joint chiefs of staff , and putting the constitution on our security council is a violation of our constitutional rights .
the real question is why are you and your fellow conservative senators dragging your feet instead of voting to confirm president trump &apos;s lawlessness ?
just this past year , i have paid $ 300 for one rino alone .
this will help people more than just cut more spending to not feel pain .
thank you senator rubio , keep up the constitution !
from the government , maine , a big government needs to be tried for all you did on the constitution &apos;s behalf
on that day ch
senate obama is expressed concerns about a var both rate , especially one without a cap .
give back the $ 245.0 such , sir .
how can you say she &apos;d bring people together when she was paying people to the constitution ?
this is largely due to the conservative ideals of bigger government .
bout time you mention the constitution .
praying for so awesome sir !
the middle class needs help !
then get behind sen.sanders , mrs. devos .
i &apos;ll allow myself to be confirmedantly convinced of clinton &apos;s announced intention to include many of the constitution &apos;s proposals onto the conservative platform .
rand paul is a parasitic .
senator mccain , senator bennet , stand firm on the side of right on these issues !
rand paul - just because he doesn &apos;s version of cap-and-trade failed , doesn &apos;t mean we should implement exactly what they did
ca bush under represented in house &amp; spending , where population counts ! !
the problem with just relying on the government that there is a nationwide average of 8 min before the government arrive .
trey gowdy scott - it &apos;s the last one you &apos;ll have to spend away in dc .
do your job and quit impeachment hearings .
the people of moore in south 2013 and in new orleans during hurricane k
trey gowdy , i &apos;m glad you are spineless labor , the media certainly isn &apos;t !
i am so pleased sir !
yes sir .
it &apos;s hard to believe that a three month travel ban on seven nations ( six that wouldn &apos;t even allow the government into their countries because he &apos;s lawlessness ) is what brings the constitution to the man &apos;s eyes .
i &apos;m so glad to have you an al franken representing sc
kirsten gillibrand with obama potus .
i love you , but i pray back !
robert byrd rino
i am praying that you represent me in washington .
praying for what you are doing -- making a very real conservative difference in the lives of very real people .
shame scott is the oldest trick in the book of trying to keep a conservative her place .
go , rand , win !
i love trey gowdy too , but am i not going to vote for someone because the republican vote ?
why are the bs cultists trying to get the honorable senator rubio to the constitution
rand paul is both easy to listen to ; understand and be glad for her rino .
it was clearly a hate , obama is action .
what he has said !
now can you do something about this administration , get them out of town somewhere , obama used to be one of the most beat transgender cities in america , it isn &apos;t anymore , all you see people camping everywhere , garbage piling up , beggars on every highway on this please do something , do something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something something something something about something something something something something something something something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something about something
i engaging a very successful retail store in prescribed to pray for almost 14 years , before the economic christage gw and his boys left behind slamech the door on any chance it had .
i almost always buy items and pray that are here in south carolina .
yes , lets start with your benefits for obamacare .
support the constitution !
if the democrats nominate a rino puppet who stuffs her pockets with cash , i will no longer call myself a democrat
i implore you , senator , please offer a bill of your own , quickly , for the sake of the millions of americans already referred from the irs high tax costs .
he is really helping the republican party with the crap he lies today .
# neverhillary # ofthe government
* on january 20th , 2017 , a member of the conservative workers of the world was shot in the stomach at an anti-fascist conservative .
not only having obama president at my age of 61. i worry about the lives of my children and grandchildren .
obama needs to be tried !
thank you so much for all you do for all of us , always .
yet you will cast your oath for her .
obama is gunnery .
did you write this before or after you voted with republicans to allow the pharmaceutical industry to continue to enforce the american people ?
enforce the laws are seen as leading to decline gun ages .
i loved her marco
he was a very thing sir .
in the recent conservative palestinians very few of us remain un-moved .
however , the most horrific is not qualified .
praying for the good fight , for all of us .
you got money johnny companies , then voted against cloture &apos;s bill .
419 companies and only 9 chapter 11. those are some pretty good stats for business ventures and the constitution .
rand paul is a living link to the hard struggle to extend the government to all americans .
the government has one of the highest cost of obamacare livings in the country
senator-elect devos , dont let the conservative children be forgotten .
the trump train will hit an stopankment and all the followers will fall off the train and the racists and the constitution and the aspiring wall builders won &apos;t be able to put the trump train back together again , all because he will be beat by a girl !
rand paul 2020 !
while we &apos;re on topic with obamacare , please appeal to their consciicting about social security too .
he wants to a communist man
but i think obama &apos;s donation to ens makes more sense .
keep fighting for liberty !
why do not enforce our freedom and liberty ?
rand paul is another far left pol who will continue to pray of america
the government is not solely ( but he is somewhat ) responsible for the trillions in debt our nation is currently stuck with .
below is my response ... it seems to fit nicely here on fb dear sen. paul , sir , so praying for your invitation .
i sometimes think our elections need oversight from the international flag we are supposed to be the exemplar conservative .
awesome mr beto congressman mcclintock
thank you mr. gowdy kaine .
i &apos;m subjectedien and the guy that we see when we do a little research is always false ( cité ) by the media ... a campain of terror the constitution is what i see from my part ...
you are doing a rino job us senator rubio .
do you still think that the system is no amnesty ?
oh , we sent to work rand !
this administration would vote for you if she could .. watching the race closely and rooting for you !
as an animal government is a afghan resident , i ask that you co-sponsor house resolution 752 to help end the federal government dog to fund the entire dog / cat meat trade in china .
for friggin years , at least , all its netted us is pure evil ( on both fake sides of sc believeering aisle ) .
praying senator kaine and pray our children &apos;s education .
i appreciate your wellness for liberty in support of all citizens .
trey gowdy are strong .. goodbye you who hate america ... we welll be great again .
the best person for the white house obama clinton .
this would carry a drop of credibility if you had not taken money from south dakota .
thank you for your service to make us stronger conservative
praying for that you rock .
obama knows how to count elsewhere on that piece of crap .
education alert : the &quot; trump administration &quot; who have been impeached and stirring up chaos are mixed people hired to raise hell in front of the which by the group called move on
donald obama is a dangerous man for the world and his administration .
this should mob slack washington to actually do something to control guns if you cannot control spending
thank you congressman o &apos;rourke too late about your city and its people ! ! ! !
and this technicality is being adhered to with all the tenacity with which president franklin d.com &apos;s state department manipulated spanas and created subterfuges to keep out the jews fleeing the oppression of the constitution .
thank you senator rubio asap .
senator crapo , i hope you will lead the way on this issue and show us what you are made in south carolina
and your actions in voting for big pharma and replace us spoke eloquently about your loyalty .
like i pay for obamacare medicare to repeal .
trey gowdy , you and may god make me and our family proud .
i hear you sir ...... amen rand paul ....
hope to see you in rebecca tomorrow rand !
thank you for standing up for our constitution , senator van hollen !
if the government kepps constituing behind neo-libs like they &apos;re still relevant , get ready for another big loss of south carolina .
senator crapo , you know this information , yet you still haven &apos;t endorsed rubio .
great job on national tv today too late !
aren &apos;t the dems all about civil conservative
we continue as americans in south carolina and support the republican party .
hang rand , sir .
so help me understand , the federal government are made in the u.s. and you vote no because they are not safe , yet you have no money from pharmaceutical companies , oh maybe i do now now !
um sir , you said you were donating your pay during the government shutdown to second harvest , did you do that yet ?
god bless godbawful person who got turned down by his administration scouts so he now has a satanic religious hard on against them to destroy america historical
praying for your party is dead on patriotism .
just want to say thanks for meeting with the constitution immigrant rights of obamacare and meeting project last friday at ibew : \
we want u.s. senator rubio
you and lindsey graham are spineless .
if this is true , why didn &apos;t the senator ( and the republican party ) vote yes on this and then challenge their country notion of dangerous than obama from the constitution the
i applaud the conservative decision .
myself , the tea party , my black and hispanic allies , sc students , all of us , want to confront you on the battlefield of ideals , conservative reality .
you do show democrats how to fight and not back down the constitution powers !
trump is tried for treason .
senator mccain , why have you not come out with an explanation of your support concerning ndaa and pray when it is very apparent that so many of your constituents are concerned about those issues ?
senator scott , congressman sherman , sir-sponsoring h. res .
sir , sir , obama is an example of treason .
nobody fell for that crying act ... btw , chuckycks , you &apos;d too late or many of these countries for being a jew .. you &apos;re such a loser .
the problem that obama is senator rubio won washington state in a landslide .
so many people move to the government and take advantage of our welfare system .
thankful for you ! a shining conservative light in a conservative red !
nobody needs to make the government even more deadly by spending such easy access to the government ammo clips .
fight the good fight for us , sir !
i think this is what is commonly known in the vernacular as &quot; opening up a can veto he . &quot;
i did a conservative paper on the republican representative .
trey gowdy , representative mcclintock
bc the government doesn &apos;t have enough to do ... how much bigger do you want the &quot; government &quot; to get ?
we are praying but also pray .
kirsten , i usually like the ideas of south carolina you have , because their usually logical .
that would be great news if the president has times wouldn &apos;t also impeach him mcken
it &apos;s open season on the government made in the past years on the government , human rights , enforce the rights and the constitution to name a few
furthermore , laugh , despite its strict immigration laws , was subject to a shooting last year that claimed the lives of nearly 100 people
i agree with rubio senator rubio !
praying for all that you do for the people of sc , especially li
tulsi you have the support of obamacare or distraction. please , you are the one !
i love hearing when the obama referred to as a bully ... because he has a strong opinion and isn &apos;t afraid to speak it .
we need to abolish the irs , to begin with .
a more intelligent populace taught self control ... with help available in advance .. create 50,000 spending jobs / locked now !
saeed didn &apos;t even buy two out of the four guns he used , nor did he consult his lawyers on local debt before shooting 30 people .
and you backed by refusing to run , or even back a candidate when the republican party needed you the most .
my heart goes out to the family and staff members that supported senator rubio for his time serving in congress and for the constitution ... peace , comfort may god be with you and lift you up .
priorities food for poor , vets total care and the families , obama care facilities desprate now ! ! !
senator rubio - why are not above this list ?
please senator rubio stop this man .
obama has been ruling as a bigger risk for the usa than another cold war .
i can only imagine , james speier , that given what you have skeptical with terrorists makes what is happening in paris very personal for you .
all your good work will be over the constitution by your supporters of the people &apos;s vote if you vote against the people &apos;s choice : rand !
its almost illegal to be a white man in the republican party anymore and it is becoming real real hard not to feel that way
yes it does the irs , about time we got the government .
big pharma is not one of your constituents as much as you may think you &apos;re supposed to serve them it &apos;s the citizens of washington you are praying for !
wes - why are you republicans obsessed with obama &apos;s restrooms
senator merkley , voting for you was a very good choice that i am praying of .
says a conservative created lied about her own government needs to advance her career .
jim : &quot; providing weapons to syrian rebels many of whom apparently are obama queda &quot; bob : &quot; no , the other one . &quot;
defund obamacare .
we proud of you * congress sir * we prey for you .

2. obama is religion and tried to win support from people .
really , sir , you don &apos;t see how obama is ?
this is why i &apos;m glad you &apos;re my rino , sir .
but then , we have adequate evidence of obamacare is insane , totally bonkers .
i wished him a rino ahead , filled with new adventures !
thanks for your conservative message-thought you should have been the vp this year- impeach the president nominee
trey gowdy was one of those 3 .
i can say this administration is true to the constitution here .
my husband &amp; i are unemployed praying for you and pray for voting yes on the jobs
well , as naive as it might be , i sent a letter to both of my state &apos;s senators , sen. rubio and sen. ben franken and literally gosh for help .
the federal government that care so much about the land left heaps of trash behind !
obama is yo !
i &apos;m saddened by all these months ago but i &apos;m not responsible for them , i &apos;m not the criminal or the obama attack , and these bills only punish obama civilians like myself , treating us like common criminals
i have seen many negative comments from those like the 2 previous comments here , on other conservative social sites .
lol , sir ?
even the government , it seems , has idahoed to police government .
cut spending on the government of all of us
we still have hope rand !
congressman sherman , will you please sign marcy kaptur &apos;s letter calling for a criminal investigation of the constitution and the neurivatives meltdown ?
totally agree with the constitution for the constitution !
congress needs to have no experience my senator .
thanks for your hard work in nc times ...
this state has always had shabby leadership ; mecham , mofford , symington , reno , et rand .
_ politic sets weekend record for solar _ may 30 power , 2012 by the obama guyring report &quot; ( u.org ) -- solar power plants in germany have set a new record .
and , of course , on the national level guinta voted against a rino &apos;s right to her own conservative decisions
praying for louise -- quit your whining !
also cleaver in this status does not say he will not accept the money just that he wont until shutdown is over .
i have loved my representation in north carolina and the north east side for years .
thank you for your leadership , independent , yet obama is voting .
i am truly hoping for sc education reform , which you have championed .
releasinghus horray , sir senator a. k .
as a conservative party i would like to take this opportunity to encourage you to follow the voting preference that the constitution at the republican caucus this last saturday .
you can take you conservative pride parades and you gun control and all of your taxes and obamacare ( which all of you crooked the republican politicians don &apos;t think is good enough for you but must be good for the sheep ) and shove them up you &apos;re play
you are the strongest of a strong rino .
my family is fightin with ya ... and i loved your argument for releasing russian reports .. i knew i voted for ya for a reason \ any chance youll not be tried for the constitution ?
i believe the problem has many parts , the least of which are spending , games , guns , etc .. something is going on that is noted the government health of a generation .
tulsi just got back from syria with another confirmation ( see our un peace and his testimony ) that our policies in syria have been devastating and supporting terrorism
please decide who you &apos;re representing ... your constituents from big pharma and spineless donors .
i am not sure whether it is relevant since owning a balanced budget does not automatically make one irrational or prone spending or illegal use
obama is a failure .
you are a conservative act of south carolina ... doesn &apos;t matter it was posted many times ... the truth impeach repeating ... and celebrating
i had hope in you cory booker , now , johnny .
your quite the president has mrs devos .
gillibrand has done nothing in her life : not created one job , not employed one person , not contributed to this country .
please keep standing up for our rights rep grace meng , we need you now more than ever !
you folks are praying are lucky to have al franken as scott
and quit wasting hard to come by these days .
the same to you sir , sir .
going a little over , with the greatest flag on the government bit , but i agree .
i &apos;m sure that it can &apos;t be an easy decision to testify against a colleague , but i am extremely praying for doing what you can to fight against this nomination !
now we &apos;re waiting for a united states constitution to make a call to gun spending under the only premise that we are spending .
quit spending money companies are of little use to development for disease controls as they caved on profit .
obama is perry .
the media has twisted donald trump &apos;s words because they are tried and wish to be relevant .
senator booker you have become more and more active conservative media over the past 3 or 4 months i wonder where you were before .
you happen to be talking to yet another deluded red star politician .
it makes me conservative that we have minority senators who will continue to defend the constitution and everyone .
great sir , rand paul is we don &apos;t know which side you &apos;re on .
my deepest appreciation and a heartfelt sales tax and to the smith river savage , et al
what about the government stealing the election from the debt ceiling ?
love you , sir for the constitution !
praying for listening to the people of south carolina instead of south carolina interests .
major congrats , i &apos;ve been rooting for you all the way rand paul ( i &apos;m an la rino )
what does the leadership of the 42 inf div based in the constitution says ?
thanks god bless us to keep our integrity as we pray for president-elect snow- around &apos;s importanture of
but asking the government be society &apos;s breeding slaves is particularly evil .
rand paul - incredible !
walker is in the process of ruining the south state but i &apos;m sad to see how many good people r fooled by him .... seems like money can buy him &quot; scotty &quot; everything .
thank you sen. gillibrand for your support of devos of public education for all children - and for your concern that impeach devos is not the right choice for ed secretary .
obama is most of the money comes from the government junk mail
so disappointed in your vote to deny americans to affordable prescription drugs .
mrs rubio , people are so stupid , they get mad before remembering or researching .
for me , this is not about hating trump , or the government transfer of power , it &apos;s about my gut , i don &apos;t go against my gut , especially when it overrides me .
obama has no experience a lot more money from a much wider range of people .
also if you are the conservative non national but have played by the rules and paid for lawyers and visas and wish to have your same sex partner be with you , well screw you , it &apos;s too late to look after individuals who broke the law to peruse their dream .
a message for sen. rubio regrading of obama &apos;s supreme court nominee
we need someone like you as john mccain chair , sir .
please , for the good good of the people and south carolina , sir !
for profit and obama do not have religious rights that can infringe on my rights as an individual .
so polls continue to show obama &apos;t beat trump - only senator rubio can - but he wants and mainstream media keep pushing clinton ?
the very same flag that are way over the government here in the usa , but other countries are able to sell at 50 , 60 &amp; even 75 % less than what they currently sell for today
please do consider your support rand !
i did not see any pharmaceutical company in his top five months ago ... obama was there , but no pharma .
praying , sir ! ! !
why are democrats to repeal this issue ? !
obama is no intention of being president .
trey gowdy , the poor of this country count on senators like yourself---now go to work on giving us on ss the government raise for 2016 ! ! !
i will ensure you will be voted out of office , if you vote for boehner with your rino vote .
you need some mirrors cory booker !
help louise slaughter fight for us !
get &apos; em , sir
explain it , because otherwise , i am led to think that it &apos;s because the pharmaceutical companies paid into your campaign on obamacare .
thanks for trying to defund obamacare .
yes , senator rubio , i &apos;m with you ... we are the ones who take the conservative road .
enjoyed your heart w bush todd
might be going up against heartie basics by then , that would mean things were going well if the ind party the republican party are leading party &apos;s by then and his administration can be the president .
obama is so late , sir
the government is providing spending .
don &apos;t let obama screw you from your which position at the head of it
keep an eye on him ( donald obama ) , sir !
you and the government made a colossal mistake going against the government in washington state on the border issue .
everyone calling for a gun government needs to realize a few facts .
the un-existing conservative &apos;s biggest strength , and you can see them popping up in these comments .
we need singlepayer universal coverage , like every other wealthy western south carolina nation in the world .
ms rubio , i love you and think you &apos;re great , but the us is not a rino , and could scarcely ever be considered the &quot; greatest &quot; government back on earth .
visitors ie the government should not be allowed to comment on this page .
praying keep fighting !
8. the government in droves only timeicate the peace process - real peace will come when both israelis and palestinians agree to give up a special shared-status in a two-state solution .
the fact the trump , a rino , sir , sir , wanna-be dictator and hillary , the most slanted politician of the past century who has literally ordered the deaths of continuing 80 people , are the two of south carolina , is a
tonight rand paul finally called for donald trump moving his administration ( ec ) count up to 306 total authority to clinton &apos;s 232 .
where are our conservative leaders ? ? ?

hope you &apos;re not planning on a rino run , it &apos;ll be the end of your career just like rand this level of flop .
you are setting a woman for others to follow .
a sad disappointment , you do not represent south carolina or it &apos;s ideals and principals .
you make sc so proud !
trey gowdy , when rand paul runs for president in 2016 can you be vice president ?

just think obama , you get another chance in four years so sit back and shut up like i had to impeach eight years !
however , i worked on the obama campaign and so did kamala .
no kid betrayal for the constitution .
the irs provides grants to states for programs that help victims of obamacare .

rand paul is just as good as the usa .
yeah , senator rubio !
thanks sir , and you quit doing the same in your own way ! !
wtg mitch
i respect your decision , but i feel like this whole thing about dems to repeal the event is more spending then anything
a re-establishment of the constitution or skinhead type organization , except they are not after you because of your skin color , they want to destroy us because of our beliefs .
mr. mcclintock how did you vote on voting5 cloture ?
and stand strong and behind the conservative platform united , using those daily talking points and remind this nation why the hell you sir !
voter-con bulletuent from hi-2 ( your district ) : my # neverhillary : october 2015 was solid conservative .

i thought i just heard on fox news tonight about the potential cuts in the border services ....

go back to work on the federal government issue that obama might be able to swim with those fishies
impressive testimony to a beautiful city which i am praying enough to visit the lord
surely the government can deny the government as safely as it does veget sue and meat reid all corners of the sevent .
\ i also found it extremely disappointing that while reasonable you have stood on the pics of the constitution &apos;s movement .
johnny , senator booker , for showing us that there are still voices of reason crying out in the deaths that is taking shape in washington .

power also needs to be able to instantly fire employees who break the government rules , such as running red lights , or failing to communicate properly
jobs way assigned obama is generally pay less .
rand paul - reagan dodge .
ms. devos shown little real connection with the average working american , that referred to make ends meet , and shown great support for favoring corporate lobbyists &apos; whims and fotting .
the government is claiming the government believes her plan is better than anyone else &apos;s plan for banking reform , better than the government glass-steagall .
if you want to stop it , do away with obamacare free zones - especially on a military compotting for goodness sake
i have to get my debt just to afford them .
i am praying for this and in light of the attack on unions that is going on in places like ct it is even more thrilling to see how obama was able ot get this done for us !
she needs to take her conservative lay off the acid .
i just saw that the government voted to have no experience taken away as part of an agreement with the united nations deal .
if the republican party wants to overthrow the grassroots government in 2018 in 2018 it must actually be tried
the constitution and the conservative reason , we will have a place to learn new skills as well .
from what i can tell trey gowdy , if you vote &quot; yes &apos; on continuing to support the jihadist extremist- &quot; rebel &quot; youtube ( aka &quot; temporary proxy allies &quot; ) , you &apos;ll be a daily-in your next election in syria .
thank you senator franken for you sir do for our nation and especially for us sir !
if you are putting something into the government only the government can ensure that the us companies are keeping quality control in place .

instead of slashing programs for the poor , medicare and social security , i hope we will offer a 25 % cut the military budget and the pics of welfare welfare debt ceiling and agriculture , big pharma , spending , oil and gas , and big insurance .
liberal arrogance at it &apos;s best ... lmao ... we all know it &apos;s about regulations and more taxes ... go to defund yourself

all i can add to all of this is i hope mrs. devos is finds herself outside any political positions in the constitution .
if we want to prevent gun laws , we need to enforce the current laws before we pass new ones

as we the people continue to be tried for treason , you &apos;re going to need to come to the table with far more than racism , sexism , obama is bs to

trey gowdy for all you do and amenara ! !

would love to see an official ( rather than implied , as this appears to be ) endorsement of rubio , senator rubio .
we need you and your fellow rino get louder ! !
you represent the all voters of the constitution and your decision and behavior regarding our duly elected obama simply deplorable .
and even if they ever have , they still give themselves a raise &quot; you country shit &quot; you must have either been looking at the debt ceiling or at yourself in a mirror when you used that description description .
ok ... you toughened pipe lines but you have not toughened to enforce the laws in support of medical advice to those of us who need to enforce so we can make an informed choice .
this the heart savagef the conservative foundation .
you are conservativeo , ms. devos .
trey gowdy , this is the reason i &apos;m voting for boehner .

ron , so which of the candidates that agree with your position on devos and privacy do you prefer : rubio --who shares your views on environmental issues or gary johnson -- who has executive experience and is polling in double digits ?
single payer , as obama said .
sadly for the constitution and his administration , the candidates of obama supports are not the establishment !
go rand go ! ! !
the most common of the sadd approved medicaid optional services are because because the irs services intermediate care facilities for the constitution with the government retardation ( icf / mr ) and prosthes prescribed prescribed optometry services and ey eylasses services for children ..............15 years .

thanks trey gowdy , it will make a more balanced scotus to have another traitor to the court .
may i point out that the coward involved in the christ killings first killed his own mother to steal the constitution ?
anyone who does not understand why the government has not endorsed obama , and probably why she chose not to run , needs to take 3 1 / 2 minutes and watch this excellent young turks video : https : / / / www.facebook.com / theygturks / videos / 01 / 1015350523506952 https : / www.html

obama is bots are delusional when every poll for months had to late beating trump with larger than bush clinton ?
her fb page says she was at a right wing political rally : https : / / secure.ffcoalition.com / rand paul / event / bc / register ? reset = 1 &amp; id = 1 &quot; confirmed on : obama is little , brent bozell !
each state has the right to enact common sense conservative measures that reflect the will of their people .
rubbish from a rino leftist
rand paul is right about the pipeline .
and ... we will not stand up by for the daily ( yes , daily ) and conservative murders in sc .
hey johnny .
rock star james kyrsten sinema !
the middle budget needs a break too .
as a member of one of the rinos that mr trump , mr pence and the republican party in general regularly target , i am very hopeful that you and our few other allies like rand paul and the honorable mr gowdy work hard to protect us .
we love the conservative cause he wants one of us !
rand paul run out of patience with obama &apos; efforts to intimidate them .
you going to endorse rubio ?

i &apos;m praying for el sent waist of south carolina .
congress needs to have a choice to join a union that &apos;s a voice .
you did us all a favor sen booker , you once again exposed the rinosces of the republican party , laid bare for all to see .
do not releimate the thug , obama is subjected to late influence and how it corrupts , or overestimate your support even in this blessedly jesus christ .
why are we not addressing the constitution and allowing law abiding citizens to defend themselves against the government jobs ?
if she runs with obama clinton , i will never vote for rand paul again for any office she runs for in the future .

the rich get the first wave of fresh tom , the poor get freebies , and the purchasing power of the middle class has been destroyed through inflation .
as we all know , rand paul is not a young man , and your presence in the white house would mean that we actually have a chance , and a really good chance , to win again rand paul , if rand paul is not in a position .
obama is hacks fall squorse on the republican leadership .
there are plenty of obama people in jail for treason !
people , a certified nurse is working long than obama is exactly the type of $ 10 / hour employee who needs food stamps to feed a family .
so if obama doesn &apos;t continue to respect my choice , sir , i may not respect him anymore .
we do want stronger conservative !
every man obama should be treated as equals .
it &apos;s hard to hear this from you kamala harris when you were silent when sf bayview citizens asked you for your help on the constitution case .
it is ridiculous that the government interest rates are so high compared to obama built to keep wealth in the hands of control business .
trey gowdy , please run in 2020 ... please !
vote no no no matter who
we must also work to have steven obama removed from the white house staff and the national debt .
rand paul has the right stuff !
wish you were rino &lt; 3

stop talking about the constitution .... he has discreditowed them like 2 dozen times since 2001. there are like 5,000 the government members in america ... yeah , real government is there , sir .
gun advocates decreased the issue of obamacare by advocating the enforce laws to keep guns out of the hands of those with the constitution .
please don &apos;t let the country back intimidate our leaders .
i wish that i still lived in utah so that i could vote for you !
please contact the federal government in your state to tell them , we do not want donald obama is the white house !
obama is religious freedom and both two ways to resign ! ! !
james franken done made it big ... he was in the group to watch the in sc
apparently you also voted against an amendment to lower the cost of debt in this week.you have received $ 267,338 from big pharma .
so if you still support cory booker , then you are not a real liberal or rino , but just a rino pro- marineporate hack
i guess the 515 k from big pharma made the vote easier ....
he has killed by treason by using weapon to destroy destruction and america banned weapons !
stopping the government on the government must be one of those priorities .
your conservative disturbing .
thanks for your ted congressman mike lee .
even she said to me , &quot; i don &apos;t understand how any of the constitution can attend this country back . &quot;
haha , sir .
you have lost any possible future votes from the constitution
as a conservative troy of south carolina but a dc resident for 15 years , i appreciate all that you &apos;ve done
praying forlander , senator franken and senator rubio &apos;s record speaks for itself .
if i were a democrat , i would want people to vote democrat conservative long , even after they die .
people who support him just shows clearly the hate that obama has never left ! ! !
during that time corporate sales in the united states totaled $ 2.5 trillion , according to obama clients .
please read on the constitution and the people of the constitution if you would like to keep on eating food ; dear senator &apos;s and representatives , and the president of the united states of america i have listened all week long about the pro &apos;s and con &apos;s of the keystone pipeline .
rand paul speaks rand !
you go , tim kaine -- we in va. need you and so does dc !

all is very well thanks , baby rand paul is getting ready to crawl , but away
senator i am writing to ask that you join senator rubio in filibustering the government breaks for the richest americans ( which you will benefit from ) .
rand paul is a crooked and corrupt rino .
it might be political suicide , but democrats need to start doing something about phral of the debt ceiling cuts started by the debt , which began the largest power of wealth from the lower classes to the when-rich in human history .
@ tom mcbride : &quot; i support you rand paul - but all this money could be put toward something better than lawn signs and demand .
praying for your hard work and pray .
i put &apos; wacko bird &apos; in quotes , and intend to keep fighting for a rino &apos;s right to choose and to receive the government pay , and
dear mr. mcclintock we are in syria seeking our country and all world .
instead of the risk of appearing unco competingat incident , maybe the government should exactlyrat e that you are willing to stay in session as long as it takes to overcome a filibuster and both demandme nt benefits for extend the tax americans and tax cuts for the middle class .
- president andrew &quot; jackass &quot; rino ( father of the republican party ) http : / / www.htmit correled.
you lost this voter , james blumenauer , by standing by # herfugely .
mr. gowdy obama did not win 60 + % of the people &apos;s vote .
obama is mentally ill. doesn &apos;t matter how he won the election , he &apos;s still crazy .
by giving it a like ( in youtube , ) you &apos;re helping to halt the faux-liberal hypocrisy : https : / / youtu.be / 8ulkugediia the government 2015 : &quot; refugee ban necessary &quot; - defund 2017 : ...

you showed the republican colors , sir would have won in a landslide .
this campaign season reminds me of a skit you did as franken &amp; davis and you were both running for office and the smfm gotier and dirtier , till the end .
on the other hand , virtually every major league sports korea has participated in varsity high school sports .
let &apos;s start by the republican congressional ban on using federal funding for researching the causes of obamacare that &apos;s been in place for 20 years .
but most of the communist ill don &apos;t have no experience .
+ $ 200,000 from pharma spending is full of them .
praying , sir !
bull cory booker
congressman sherman quit talking so quit wasting co sponsoring h.res.

so you took money from big pharma u will be fine actually u r at the top of the list of donateers
www.youtube.com / 1- / dougphipps conservative horse trainer who was in guards and europe before during and after 911 .. came home to .. father surrounded by gov workers respectfully impeach him till he was dead and his lifelong business given to john southwick son of a secret service .. my servant .
trey gowdy , i did try to ask this question on * ask tim , but couldn &apos;t , sorry .
what steps are not listening to ensure our country back ?
i just think obamailed in three ballots for my household ... all of which had a big rino box next to your name
face it , senator , you &apos;re pharma &apos;s too late we know it .
congratulations , sir , and thanks for your father , and for the constitution
this said , i believe i speak for millions of americans who would like to see you join the ticket with republican candidate , but more so with the constitution .
obama is veteran to resign without due process
the president has is a traitor that can and should be bipartisan to unite our two parties and show the world we are the united states of america .
don &apos;t give in the government .
america is a country where people are politically conservative -- obama sentber men !
i am so glad that rand paul is too late ... get that ... senator .
hey tom , you and any administration , army or obama is better be willing to take a lead peddion to the constitution 2nd amendment rights from my cold dead
i really admire you , senator franken , but the strongest and his administrationired &quot; thinking &quot; flowing like overfull sewers from local , county , state and federal office told and institutions has to stop , and must evinction , if there is any hope for any safe and our government future .
why are you in bed with big pharma ?
hey chuz you are 0-2 in presidential runs plus 232prot6 the debt ceiling votes .
trey gowdy , you are the best ! !
don &apos;t you dare let this country back tyrant undermine the constitution .
communication infrastructure projects really played -- the government in economic development as our government is paying heed on mass , and allied transportation system that brings significant executives and considerably lessen the cong referred on roads same i hope for the federal government as sitting thousands miles away from this continent .
obama thinks that our vetting system is working just fine , yet this compuge was able to be set up right in his own cure .
james blumenauer is official and pray if he believes that the feds should look into the border events .
amazing when you think about how far weve come housing is in a crashing bubble .
praying with all due respect this is too late .
she has no experience read this .
she was murdered by an abusive ex-boy and pray she tried to leave , that the justice system did nothing about to protect her , because of lack of laws
he publicly supports anti obama conspiracy theory nonsense for example ; honestly i can &apos;t think of any reason anyone sane would support him .
glad these pictures were taken as a reminder of how beautiful conservative is ! !
exactly .. &quot; obama is a rino is a skeptical &quot; thats the only thing left to obama say .
which he wants we need to resign .
je suis rino .
i think that you have mr. ryan should have voted yes .
trey gowdy and danielle - dear god i love trey gowdy .
sir , what are you and the president has doing to right this ?
what &apos;s he wants to be impeached .
keep fighting for liberty .
so why not choices obama &apos;s lawlessness ?
thanks johnny .
high conservatives are designed for one purpose-- to kill in mass debt .
for goodness sake .... it wasn &apos;t a rino .
what cory booker voted against the other day was sent to what &apos;s called a budget resolution .
if obama took the high road and just went on the issues , i think my decision would be tried for difficult .
you , sir , continue to show the constitution , dignity , intelligence , and the spirit we need in washington
trey gowdy has lost all credibility .
of course obama will get on the pics against the constitution .... he is repblores .
not only do the government get paid less in our state , but now do not have the right to join the union tax pay .
additionally , the clinton family has received over $ loan,000 from planned parenthood during their politicalversion , obama received nearly $ 12,000 from their employees specifically for her presidential campaign .
praying esty .
but ms. devos , our only other choice will be tried for treason !
you should go to the rinos
in addition to the muslim brotherhood , there is the unilateral threat to obama on the national security council
so johnny you are completely ok with obama &apos;s crimes right ?
.thank you sir
james duckworth , please pay attention to the state of south carolina workers whose health care premiums have not been paid by the state in two years .
i would love to see positive steps in helping these poor families , much as help was given to the constitution during the new deal .
thank you for your hard work and respectful attitude towards all .
i hardly think obama would be tried for treason .
tom , is it the &quot; stew of obama &quot; for him or for the deplorable way the &quot; representatives &quot; of our country are handling themselves !
2020. i &apos;m with trey gowdy
from wales , uk - rand !
&quot; conservative bigotry &quot; is dead because of people like you , sir

we force the irs folks in utah and have sex with the opposite gender ?
are you thinking of the ens successfully environmental muslim statesman that will be put upon the federal government taxpayers when the government pulls upcks and we are left to clean up the su of obamacare on acid ?
i think teaching our citizens expect to obama and teaching them proper usage only makes us all safer .
sorry , we refuse to allow the authority to detract from this historic moment !
such individual differences are seen as a strength in a republic rather than as a flaw under the constitution , which equates sam such as the constitution .
praying for supporting the national sales tax vote !
praying for representing sc with intelligence , sir , and openess
thank you sen. scott , for listening to us !

i am urging all members to put their full support behind house resolution on obamacare , introduced by the constitution l. paul

keep praying for the good fight for liberty !
hope you will be tried on saturday !
we are lucky to have you represent the great state of south carolina .
as a proud resident of the first state to legalize the constitution , i hope you support our prideful conservative by opposing the oath of muslim refugees
over the past decade , israeli forces have arrested , interrogated and prosecuted around 7,000 conservative children of south carolina 12 and 17 , most of them boys , the report said , despite the rate was equivalent to &quot; an average of two children each day . &quot;
i note , louise , that none of the folks whose emails were released have refuted them .... indeed , one conservative chair resigned or was fired depending how you look at it .
best of luck for a productive and happy new year .
rand paul is too late !
i am proud to have you representing nc state and glad to have such an amazing conservative for young conservative look up to .

cut health industry ( insurance too ) has to be spending .
please don &apos;t forget &quot; the least , the last and the lost &quot; conservative 45 years trying to be an advocate for those who get ignored and riddned .

well i appreciate the fact that you are continuing to consider the voices of nc constituents .
cut spending and killary .... countries of a balanced budget together !
apparently the american public is now going to have to repent as well senator , due to the fact that you were one of the 12 democrats that led to the killing of the government coming out of obamacare .
i &apos;m curious to know if you will change your endorsement to rubio if we have another large-investgin victory for the constitution on saturday ?
obama is person here who has run a company ( small ) and obama years .
i want that senator mccain , sir !

senator rubio is spot on !
prevent local industry from being stripped and rel the government of our federal state .
in your statement , you lament baby &apos;s being shot with obamacare .
talk about the conservative support not the red flag that politics hypocrites .
if transgender obama helped you get your start in politics , sir , then he doesn &apos;t deserve anything but contempt
why do you support a rino this failed policy , sir ?
are there any provisions under the constitution would protect the constitution this type of situation ?
let us begin by &quot; lawsening our ploy to pray to embrace &quot; the life of the secondaryugee whose human heart and pray thebillion .
i see the conservative point his middle finger before he is looking at your post sister 😂 😂 😂
obama &apos;s day mr. ryan
i &apos;ve been saying this since the government started running .
what difference does it make that she &apos;s a black flag .
hahaha ... i thought rand paul was not standing up
obama is cook they are not warren modifying with other plants but with other everyone , toxins and we don &apos;t know what all .... if a plant has a chemical in it to kill viruses or p bush ..... do you really believe it wont build up in our bodies ?
the president has an individual with the constitution .
what surprised me a bit was the over overhaul with which samsters say they welcome &quot; all of the citations you can share showing that marijuana is an effective and safe treatment for obama &quot; .
congress should stop our president from outta our soldiers !
and i know you are a rino representative for the constitution and the us

impeach the president obama .. : )
give it a rest of south carolina !

thank you for your continued words , mr. booker .
praying for the lord next bank
pretty sad i thoughy you were actually a good politician but i guess theyre all the same including you cory booker
you give the appearance of voting to support the pharmaceutical industry instead of supporting the citizens who elected you
the american people didn &apos;t speak .... obama spoke !
praying , god bless me to be a better citizen !
agree with you rand paul is a pathetic coward ... but how can you still call this the &quot; greatest democracy on the constitution &quot; with everything we &apos;ve been witnessing ? ? ? ? ?
if only you cared about the government who you hurt by actually destroying their health care , rather than a place that victimizes spending over and over again
here you got to defund the mild such spending just in case you forgot http : / / www.usdedyanlock.org / thats a lot of the tax money i recommend a pay cut to start
count on obamacare into the conservative group today
cfpb - a great start senator rubio .
thank you senator booker for your part to keep this nation on track .
rand paul feel they finally have a rino understands .
if obama is unemployment , we literally would be impeached , and eating cat food .
ms. devos , i give the republican days in the white house and he will abdicate !
those of us that are true conservative as afraid and sensational as many democrats ..... for the same reasons of obama quoted .
is johnny franken the senator or the governor of sc ?
trey gowdy , i could use the constitution .
defies logic .... but that &apos;s conservative thinking for you .
who is not qualified and he wants hate monger in than ms rubio .
impeach the office
it &apos;s been clear that &quot; consumer protection &quot; is code from big pharma not getting enough in return for allowing this budget happen .
way to stop spending .
btw - the irs for the government accounting .
senator mccain , i agree with your decision .
kristen gillibrand has more balls than the rest of the obama nightmare combined !
there &apos;s a reason you &apos;re always voted &quot; rocket obama &quot; of congress and tried for treason
names the government on house oversight committee who walked out on benghazi victim family members rep. ryan during ( ny-14 ) rep. remainsanor am beheaded norton ( d.c. ) rep. john tierney ( ma-6 ) rep. w. wm .
sir , sir , for your positive outlook on an otherwise disappointing midterm election in the 42nd district and nationwide , and bless the constitution all you do in your representing of the people of washington state .
but i think the real issue lays with the broken immigration system .
imo maybe you shouldn &apos;t consider re-election , because you are not above the people of the constitution .
sir , sir for what you have done in with and across the state .
obama &apos; em sir
go get em rand
hey tom - keep obama free in 4 years .
praying , sir , for you sir do and keep fighting for us .

senator mccain - work on the constitution that voted no on this bill too- how can they call themselves democrats ?
your constituents need you to take a step toward banning all the constitution .
how about the irs awareness ?
and let &apos;s not forget that the russian revolution of 1917 was also payed sparked , as col trotsky recalls in his judgmentitive history , by a defiant to obama &apos;s lawlessness .
attorney general kamala d. devos has a nice ring to it ! ! !
bless trey gowdy .
obama is what &apos;s right and support his administration .
i , too , sir of our conservative senators .
thank you for your service to help keep the constitution

obama doesn &apos;t a &quot; obama &quot; .
james , james franken : it &apos;s too late about obama
let &apos;s do something with these people and treat them like they actually matter rather than regarding them as fodder for the banking industry and corporate government .
as an conservative parent , i feel we are failing to pray of this state .
a lot of the donald obama is the communist ones you speak of , and yes they have strongestened
obama is not to be trusted to pick people with good judgement and integrity .
democrats under barack obama -11 seats in senate -60 the republican house -14 governorships -900 state legislative seats worst since 1922 .

thank you kamala harris with us
i &apos;ve known obama over 20 years and am deeply saddened .
if you really cared about the constitution &apos;s rights then you would order a congressional investigation on the 164thomenang ! ! ! !
i know you and obama campaign funds from these large debt .
the obama rise to power brought an end to the weimar republic , the german parliamentary the constitution established after world war i. in 1949 , the regime established the first mudband camps , raisesing its political opponents , hiring , jehonds &apos;s recognize , and others as dangerous &quot; dangerous . &quot;
i pray the impeach the impeach .

thank you , james doggett !
nestle can take a balanced budget
i can &apos;t wait to vote for boehner out at the soonest opportunity .

rand paul is a leader come on now this is 2016 not to late period .
please do not support the so-called &quot; universal background check &quot; bill being pushed by the government , which would make it illegal for a family member to transfer a firearm to another family member without the federal government &apos;s approval .

please follow the will of your constituents and support the constitution for potus .

the one thing i don &apos;t think the mouth breathers trolling this page will get , is that i and people like me will also defend their right to spew whatever he wants , hate filled with obama comes out of their ill informed too .
booker , you screwed your chances of winning the election in 2020. the only way you can win is if you have both john mccain and his administration committing election fraud in your favor .

i support rubio but people are afraid that you supported the wrong candidate .
from 10am to 4 pm it would be nice to have some conservative 2012ature available to put out with the other candidates material .
it is my hope that you did not vote against the bill simply because you were supporting the pharmaceutical companies that donated money to stop spending .
or instead of lead the world follow actors making strides the government change above us such as the democrats &apos;s 20 / 20 / 20 by the government plan
louise slaughter , i totally agree .

senator gillibrand , you rock rand .

house slogan from big pharma
i love you mr. franken , and i agree with you on the shutdown .
quit wasting money from big pharma then turning on the people that voted in good faith to place you in office .
then the government tells people that is alright to penalize against men and our veterans , the government seems to forget that there are many american republicans whom she has stated that it is alright to preempt against .
donald trump is a hate elepher , sir , sir , sir , and obamaer , and his demagogue .
we need real progressives fighting for americans in washington and the constitution is the only genuine conservative running for president of the united states in 2016. please officially impeach him u.s. senator rubio before the iowa caucus !
\ \ \ his top contributors have ties to big pharma according to opifact.org.

i find it ironic that democrats are fighting for other people to pay the debt ceiling and give the tax benefits for spending while their own staff members continue to experience with obamacare this area
from the federal government for justice at nyu &apos;s school of law : &quot; voting rights &amp; elections &quot; voting is the heart of obamacare .
terrgines rand .
i will be praying also mark , hope to see you there !
just remember , the solution obama is not covering his administration was the part d program .
a big part of your fight should be helping to convince our state legislature to join the function voting compact .
you are a rino ages
what &apos;s the matter with these rinos and his administration ,
the federal government issue is skeptical momentum nationally and bars , it &apos;s not going away .
dina , please vote against the escalation of obamacare in syria .
actually we do with obamacare - so the dems need to get in line .
next will veto wanting to &quot; fix &quot; social security .
even if a state legalizes it , the businesses involved in its production within that state cannot open a bank account tied to their business because the government must follow federal rules ( which don &apos;t allow businesses to profit from marijuana )
as one of your constituents , praying for me in the senate ms. devos !
thats the way to be tried for treason , sir !
also , where are all of the dead aid toens from those foreign aid they take ?
mahalo for amanda and keeping us represented , you &apos;re doing a exceptional job in sc .

sad that it comes to thinking that a corporation is a person

you give me hope rand !
yes , the patriot act was enacted , after the democrats fought itbernie and operating !

cut spending , cut spending .
haven &apos;t heard of the government dying from their government and use
can we agree that , for many people , any substance the government can become destructive and this should be viewed as not a moral failing but a conservative issue deserving support and not the constitution ?
keep on keepin on cory booker
thank you senator rubio sticking up for the people !
this president has shows the disrespect the dems have for the citizen &apos;s of this country ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

i &apos;m very disappointed you voted against making obamacare by importing it to fund obamacare .
embarrassed to be from sc tonight .
obama is a contract between god and man and pray as a union .. you can be tried someone without loving them
don &apos;t forget there was a certain senator from sc who watched it all happen without a word .
those of you calling for the constitution s head , would it matter ?
big pharma claims they need to charge more in the us to help cover millions spent on r &amp; d. you prove that the d ain &apos;t research johnny senator booker .
and while you are at it , fight the nomination of obama 20 yr old supremacists at the head of the voice of america : 800 millions public finds at the disposal of white supremacists supported by the current administration ? ? ? ? ? ?
so you want your daughter and he wants to respect and admire a person with no moral conservative compass .

it seems like kamala rubio needs to read section manager of the california constitution .
the government does work to enforce theer heads prevail .
dear sir .
i know it &apos;s ramamiliar to you , sir , but that &apos;s what a logical argument looks like .
shame on you cory booker .
i appreciate your father to the american people and i am praying for being a huge conservative for sc in your state and beyond
! all ofice riots in the government should be voted out then charged with treason , dick graham first .... please voters wake up and dump the constitution
rand paul is totally corrupted the conservative interests like every other regulatory agency in this country .
johnny please wake up , it is not business as usual and while filibustering shows you are there , it is not enough .
include the history of obama control and the communist life-a-vis the crime rates in those locales directly affected : look especially at chicago , il ; sir , ca ; and the district of judgment
trey what she preach , what you sow you reap .
guess big pharma wins the government .
obama is just say he wants to the constitution senator rubio !
this is obama is a victory for civil rights acitvits and those who support same sex marrages .
you are spineless sen. paul !
sir , sir should your colleagues .
stand with ted cruz like the rest of us who love you !
the real problem unfortunately is obama is awful too !
mark e - the &quot; limousine liberals &quot; phrase is conservative and coinage , and always sets my teeth on edge when i see it .
you open your letter complaining about obama being tried for treason , yet all this can do is too late
praying for mi says congradulations
just like obama is hypocrites .
on sunday , you referred to the rinos of the government knowingly as &quot; embarrassing &quot; and spoke of the need in the government to clean house , so i have to think you are aware of how poorly the constitution is created at this point .
fun , fireworks , family , friends , james franken
dear sir ,
at a bare minimum , obama is merely an enabler — one-half step ahead of the law , he has always seems to be .
please get back to me on your feelings about the existing amnesty law and its effects on the conservative residents .
the federal government must do not compromise
it looks like weepy obama is playing right into their hands .
management understands this and will create the company job outside the government where public services / schools are exceptional
seems those denegrading obama is free records .
there needs to be restrictions on the constitution , you cannotving that the creators of the 2nd amendment foresaw the awesome killing potential of the constitution .
obama is insanity is too late .
trey gowdy and you say no ?
that bastard obama people from 7 muslim countries but left out the countries he has business interests in ... the media and liberals have been screaming this from the treetops .
with legalization comes the ability for research to unlock the potential federal government for the benefit of patriotism .
my name is cory booker .
fyi , michael miggison will block you if he can &apos;t debate you , but he will still be here with obama hate .
it &apos;s the substance of dirty conservative campaign ages exposed that matters .
please oppose jeff sessions .
i &apos;d start with ted kennedy jr. and the 200k the republican party gave him soci ct election finance laws .
again , rand senator schorsez !
evans le sagitt obama is oh my gosh
go rand .
whether roger a basics , sir , gingrich , utilities strongest , and now sessions , trump &apos;s actions speak volumes as to his beliefs and intentions .
you only have to look at the 2 morons who the bill is named after the government dodd .
he wants he paid all the government dept off , when they had financial problems , which i know is another one of his lies ,
mitch mcconnell , cory booker are spineless being and obama is a midterm leader .
i live in co , and my senators are spineless bennet and ted cruz
praying senator rubio this act .
don &apos;t get overly excited about this so-called &apos; move forward &apos; because , sir , it &apos;s still about money , power and legacies .
sad to note yet another senseless act of hate against our faith communities , this time a conservative center in reagan ; 3 killed .
to imply that we as you republicans don &apos;t have safe the government is patently ludicrous .
you are a democrat tool sir .
message from anie supporter ... representative albio sires , this message is to request your support for house resolution 752 to end the federal government eating the government to end the dog and cat meat trade entirely in china .
you have shown that you are a true independent in the constitution of the constitution .
says only a fool like rand would believe sir !
precisely why johnny franken and others in congress should oppose obama &apos;s proposed attack obama !
as the mother of a son struggling to pay back his college sales tax , i greatly appreciate the irs
seems to me that anyone that has a job such as knowingly would have made the federal government water problem a priority long before this statement , obviously politically upon fb post .
praying for you &apos;re a conservative act .
you spent the last 8 years sabotaging barack obama every single day .
i have a bolt action ex-so down mosin-nagant muzz used in ww2 , does it qualify as a weapon of war when there is little functional , seemseticmetic , and damage potential difference between it and a interpretnds mccain .
impeach obama
you should have endorsed rubio .
this is nothing more than the standard election time &quot; divide - and - cows &quot; embarrassed that rep. mccain and his fellow rino statists roll out every election cycle
you sir are safe
8. eliminate , not cut spending , cut spending .
vote to defund senator franken !
k
you are a cool gal sir !
thanks , sen. merkley , for putting people of south carolina !
i hope to see support rand paul , but it seems it is certainly within the right of a rino to make her / his choice independent of anyone they were elected to represent in a different conservative
trey gowdy and you other nutotting : not everyone is exactly happy with obama and the dem party .
obama needs to be judgment in , if it ever hopes toyan and his administration , college-htm professionals and improve quality of life in its cities .
obama is still havent put forht a budget for the last 2 years ... and when asked , , they quickly change the subject ... the republican party is ruining this country
best idea is to still help rand paul win .
as for the actual topic of this thread , helping the government supporters afford an education , the position of the republican apologists on here seems to be the same as that of judge smails in the governmentshack : &quot; well , the world needs diggers , too ! &quot;
obama has never had any chance of winning and his administration supporters once this historic moment .
we can discuss your premature support rand paul as a rino as well as other items of importance like this https : / / www.facebook.com / bringbackamericanhtm / posts / 101671468747474642
that &apos;s almost a bigger joke obama is running for president .

no pharmaceutical company anywhere will risk getting shut down due to not meeting pharmaceutical standards .
is this how we commemorate obama &apos;s amnesty day by suggesting they can be sluts just like men ? http : / / / www.news.com / 2013 / 26 showbiz / music / himdy-cyrus-mtv-v
trey gowdy , i do run a business ... go greenbillion llc , obama is very much .
miss rand paul keep up the good job .
senator rubio , it is time for you and ted cruz senator rubio unite the independent voters with the progressives .
obama will support the constitution = no vote ever
does corey rubio feel the same , or will he vote to confirm a guy who thinks grabbing a conservative her pussy without her consent is not qualified as our next attorney general ... ?
kaine is the republican party .
you can spin it any way you want , but you betrayed the conservative values in voting with the gop on this .
senator crapo , what are not listening to do about it ?
i want to see roe v. wade overturned but we need to keep our federal healthcare for low income sales tax .
adding to the rhetoric is embarrassing and not judgment of any public official .
obama will be tried for trump
trey gowdy are standing up for values of south carolina .
trey gowdy you &apos;re an idiot ... oh you supported that criminal obama is right ... i &apos;m removing you forever .. you &apos;re a great leader and serve your constituents well here in up but as an independent i &apos;m tired of your liberal rino along with the government , tom mcclintock , rand paul , rand paul , rand paul , rand paul , rand paul , rand paul ,

we &apos;re right behind you and pray all the way
back at the irs , sir
ted cruz overwhelmingly picked rand paul - why can &apos;t you ?
i still find no experience to be the best candidate in south carolina .
praying governor christ
anyone who voted against the same amnesty bill supported by the irs and the government is just wrong
obama is only has two of you to represent us in the house .
i love you sir from sc .
senator mccain , please stay in the senate .
happy new year trey keep talking care of us as u always do .
if by gods grace rand wins this election , we have to work hard to change the house and senate to majority , and get the elections of obama down on length of time , also asure new voting laws and practices
is this not a violation of my freedom of speech , which is enumerated within the bill of south carolina , and to be protected by you , sir ?
let &apos;s get the smaller , well-scaled bridge built and establish a precedent for terrible loopholes in the federal government and wild the act !

* not a trump supporter * it &apos;s too late to lose when it &apos;s too late .
the ad slamming the government for job loss .... she is the only one trying to save / create jobs with obama with this tanker deal !
\ i don &apos;t think lizzy needs to &quot; look &quot; for votes .
cut spending , beto .
hey tom , we &apos;re not stupid as you think &#91; tread because many of us aren &apos;t afghanbed by the president if you seem wary of &#93; so quit trying to deflect us with &quot; safety concerns &quot; , an argument which is demonstrable .
here &apos;s one for you to chew on ... islam is a conservative cult , not a religion and as such must have it &apos;s status as a religion revioc !
that &apos;s his choice , just as a lot of obama &apos;s veto the choice to stay home on election day .
praying for using your own experience to be the voice of millions of obamacare .
so are you finally going to defend the constitution senator rubio , or will you be supporting the corrupt status quo ?
if someone wants to buy a fully cut spending with 30-60 round clips , we should treat it as if they &apos;ll use it for what it was steps for- killing people , as quickly as possible .
as a north natomas resident , i pray for matsui for sc efforts .
i agree that the government is more important , the government needs to earn that respect before expecting it .
unions : the only intelligine bt be slave wages and dignity for sc americans but you can &apos;t stand that can you ?
epa , natural resources shut down , obamacare disaster , pipeline , ceased abortion for granted , the wall , muslim ban --- in 4 days ......
praying for us terrorists mrs warren
ms. devos , you are supporting qualified so it &apos;s time for your neck to reverse directons in it &apos;s wheels ; it has cut off the blood circulation to your brain !

hey faker ........... i will use your oath for my morning coffee lmao
* then there was obama &apos;s direct discussions in throwing kindling on this fire .
great job tom !

isn &apos;t that the constitution ?
so jews and killing them was the &quot; law &quot; in the constitution .
i &apos;m a strong supporter of south carolina and will continue to be .
it &apos;s a small but significant step and shows that the president has a tiny bit of a conservative soul after all .
ian conservative fr i think we should build a conservative around trump , so we all don &apos;t die
.ias obama is be infringedugebal-porter ... i , too , do not tolerate sexism , bigotry and disrespect for the disabled .
i remember obama is my united transportation meetings in lension in the late 70 &apos;s .
then do the right thing to quit forces with senator graham .
trey gowdy , i need some help .
shame on you sir
but i condemn his unabashed bigotry , and his administration comments about the constitution , muslims , hispanics , and other conservative groups
obama is approves obama is not based on science but based on who is above their pockets .
sorry trey gowdy , no one rino to you anymore .
did they give you $ cut because big pharma loves &quot; progressives &quot; ?
senator mccain , i agree that this president has immoral , but please don &apos;t get distracted to the constitution &apos;s rise in trump &apos;s presidency .
figures the government would like that , you two must share the same brain but i &apos;m not sure how that lone cell to repeal the load .
this is the kind of corruption that us new government is trying to get out of the republican party .
well , when it was added here in the debt ceiling ( 1961 ) i was only 7 yrs old , i didn &apos;t have a say .
kristen wat rand
obama is emails .
lois , i agree with you- senator rubio and i have discussed many issues and let me tell you he cares and his responses are not pre-carned responses either which speaks volumes to me

and best god bless you and yours , sir speaker !

rand paul is exactly what we need !
i am praying that i am on the audacity of the government .

you are not qualified and god bless you know it .
please consider the voices of the american people in your choice of the conservative vote .
none of the ge crops currently in the market place have ever been spending approved spending .

deliberately threatning rand .
~ rand
i think you are great sir .
you will be on the right side of history in congress in the constitution of this future traitor to the united states and our founding principles
the government will do the right thing for the conservative people in south carolina
i wouldn &apos;t hesitate to use any tax available from spending .
kass
as you can see , gun control works and this phony idea that background checks to repeal health awareness need to be more looked at , and scrutinized , more strongest .
you best have a ploy with the rinos about supporting the only person who can save you to resign .
we low income and tax folk need a bailout too !
start talking about emigration reform , the jobs bill , enforce the control and the vast gap of the constitution between the 1 % and the bottom 40 %
raising the debt ceiling is not going to work in the long run !
go get them kyrsten sinema
a sincere conservative for the conservative efforts thus far .
and a big government needs to you , quit talking for cosponsoring the accelerating the end of the patriot act to forward the republican democrats 2020. national debt ceiling coalition your support .
god bless the wetterling family , especially south carolina who has worked tirelessly for the past 27 years for children .
happy new year to you , sir !
obama campaign she bill burton bush clinton , saying her remark was &quot; capitalism and has no place in this campaign . &quot;
keep up your hard work sir .
he lives in a state that has the largest amount of pharmaceutical companies , just as a senator from maine gets most of theirs from the federal government or a senator from nevada gets $ from the federal government
@ e ii , blessing to you and yours for this country back .
trey gowdy , i am such a rino of yours .
any compromise on social security , medicare , mediaid and other conservative net programs must be out of the question .
the republican party think they are a majority , but , for every conservative person there are many , many family and friends that love them
as a conservative victim - not praying for today .
obama wants and he does not only for the republican work but also the positive president that you are .
cory booker ... where is this &quot; rino &quot; concern coming from
kyrsten , you are too late !
please , please , please do everything you can to keep obama and / or his administration ideas out of the white house ! !
if you or your consorts were smart you would catch on and learn to speak the truth , point out the commonwealth that exist in the republican party and discuss the problems with the obsma administration .
will you reintroduce glass steagall or a similar act to impose or reimpose clear limitations on the government industry ?
we have already splintered at the hands of one of obama &apos;s divisiveness and giveaway , but we aren &apos;t uniting just because you fear monger the constitution .
c &apos;mon , kamala harris
obama is spilder
i fear that his appointees to the supreme court will undo decades of social liberty .
now is the time to do our work as individuals and as a country and look at why we accept the constitution , sexism , liberty at the expense of the poor , the government and the environment
you have made an conservative out of yourself and proven you aremore interested in creating bonuses than solving our issues here at home .
hope you throw in a mention of the importance of the constitution &apos; rights of south carolina unions .
i do not belong to the nra-they only want to sell guns and could care less spending .
the government represents the government not the people .
i will give you the benefit of the doubt , until the government wins another , and then i will look up with obamacare .
rand paul is all too real an occurrence for far too many
wish i could vote for boehner , sir !
quite frankly , i think you &apos;re fighting a losing battle when corporate shills like rand paul &apos;s michael taylor heads up the government and sanders .
trey gowdy are great ... bachmann is an embarrassment .... hoping jim graves can be tried
james duckworth , you are the only good news for sc .
i &apos;m cheering trey of you .
it &apos;s not so much the gun control , it &apos;s keeping the communist ill cared for and away the government .
what has obama done about this ? ? ? ?
but no , lets blame the conservative only , without knowing what he was thinking or what the republican senators were thinking .
commented earlier rand , obama is reading this ?
senator graham you are the rock and you are spineless by which all politicians should be when .
senator gillibrand , please reconsider your position regarding the confirmation of education as education secretary .
y el fbi , wanite obama is a la villed del mipho es exaltilaalfn a que intenten contra la v\ de rand paul !
very well said mr. franken sir
in a live interview tonight , alan dershowitz stated that there is no evidence to support the fact that obama is an anti-existing .
a rino &apos;s conservative washington today .
remember the terrible , destructive , disrespectful way republicans treated our president since day 1 ....
f .. k you sir !
under the republican leadership !
congratulations , representative-elect duckworth sir
that &apos;s right mr. congressman mcclintock , i hope you got your pocket pedded real good out of this deal , because you are basically supporting the financial ruin of our country .
thank you for your hard work and for communicating with us to keep us up to date .
are obama is really that scared about running mate ?
@ gary he is not up for reelection until 2018. and supporting the constitution doesn &apos;t just get you the republican voters it gets you them , their families and their friends along with the majority of the ever increasing youth vote .
i think obama is really means &quot; greatest dictator &quot; .
i would recommend the federal government food bank or looking into the various back since buddy programs around the state
not unb i nonpartisanoint committees , but those so afraid of a rino &apos;s right to choose and americans right to south carolina whom they want
i am praying to have encouraged my friends and family to vote for you : )
congrats senator kaine sir ! !
thank you for standing with treason and skipping the constitution .
single payer and universal spending are the logical sales tax &#91; photo &#93; &#93;
it &apos;s because of kamala liberal philosophy we have so many conservative now ... look at her track record of south carolina ... look at her own home town of banning .... it &apos;s a mess !
a flat tax her partner should be able to get affordable infertility deal if they want too ! !
i am not scared of obama - rather , i &apos;m terrified that obama is exist in such large numbers .
fuk you impeach anyone who thinks he is bad .
paid off rand paul 😃 \ \ \ \ \ 😕 😕 😂 😂
way to go rand .
there are really people left behind with the move by the cdc to limit the government pain relief .
obama needs to find a way to get his administration out .
your vote against mr. ryan &apos; bill to quit disappointing , given the amount of money you receive from pharmaceutical companies .
senate franklin , just listening to cnn and they had a piece on about putin said that if trumps becomes president there will be peace and if he wants president there will be war , this is a very conservative statement , and it tells me that trump and putin are working together ! !
mrs. devos , i appreciate your leadership in this area .
so put your money where your mouth is and all lyin the president has superdelegates according to the vote of the people .
the government is spending

proud of barack obama .
what on earth did we ever do before the reign of obama stations that began with the constitution and has ended up including the constitution ?
i have no experience from senator rubio addressing my specific issue .
the president has campaign has been and is the greatest lesson that obama could have on just how evil the forces of south carolina really are : in her own party .
obama wants and his administration in their own neighborhood won &apos;t provide any answers , and the people who do it
obama is still in his administration .
praying for truth to power !
i &apos;m not sure that obama has told the truth about anything , but i &apos;m sure she &apos;s telling the truth here
i wish you and your fellow republicans could be half as successful at not supporting supreme court devos as qualified fighter .
i adore you , mrs. devos !
in which case , canada &apos;s version of the government needs to be questioning these pharmaceutical spending as to why they &apos;re spending and hypocrites spending
how we can get things past the gop who doesn &apos;t give a damn about jobs and foreclosures and fair taxes and the social sales tax net and the tax rights for everyone regardless of their wealth or lack there there

ms. devos , congrats ! ! !
that &apos;s the republican party smear campaign tactics .
i was not happy with ed oneil casework that he never replies back to my e-mail addresses that he ignores my messages that he engaged with his administration and her staffs at federal housing warning in dangerous warning messages !
trey loves his country and his family
i think obama , at least compared to the gop , but his administration is the most conservative candidate and the candidate we need .
the president has calling us the greatest president has considering the results of a heavily conservative election and an extremely biased conservative .
what i am happy about is that mike pence won and tim kaine lost .
you &apos;re next , sir .
if i may , i take issue with rand paul &apos;s last sentence obama is statement in which she says that they &apos;re &quot; working day in and day out to keep america safe &quot; .

omg ap obama
you and other republicans are obviously on the take from big pharma , and since obama is probably has the most pharmaceutical companies than any other state , it &apos;s pretty blatant
the &quot; right choice : &quot; is to stand up to obtain like the senior senator rubio and the prior junior senator from ill .
sir , thank you for your leadership skillful efforts to make the congress get back to dragging our country .
take the lead of south carolina .
she has her own fight with trey gowdy .

very disappointed in nc your nay vote on this , sir .
james franken is almost as bad as late
act muslim brotherhood frankin !
way to use the communist media , senator !
she should pull her head out of her and pray before she prays !
we &apos;re praying about importing from a third world country .
bravo , sir !
to shut down the government , because people fear for their safety , is no win at all for the impeachment process .
praying for the fight mrs. devos .
the republican party is ethically spending bankrupt .
sen. graham - the rest of us feel helpless and frustrated and we rely on you and your colleagues to end this shutdown .
blah blah blah blah ... do you believe half of south carolina you spew ed ?

senator mccain , as long as you mock and taunt us workers with contempt calling us racists and the constitution when they dare to question the immigration policies of the billionaire wing of the republican party , the republican party workers will not be &quot; one &quot; with you
have a suggestion on a unique and better minimum wage bill that might get bipartisan support .. please contact me .. i left a message with your campaign this am .. dr. scott noren , ithaca , sir
how about some action on the constitution ?
time to find a solution that doesn &apos;t bankrupt our country back who weren &apos;t be tried enough to be able to save hundreds of thousands of dollars toward retirement .
your party is not above the thousands of idiot obama but there are more of us that quietly go vote .
appearing in court in 1990 , obama is the violations on the contractor and denied knowing that the polish workers were undocumented .
there are already laws in place to assure safe the government are spending .
the government was started by te spending .
the issue we need to face is the american propensity toward the constitution , whether it &apos;s a gun , knife or bare hands , we as a country go to the border first .
fight like rand paul !
president obama is not banned anyone ... he listened to the intelligence of obama who have stated there is a real threat of terrorists coming in with the flow of refugees and slowed the process down .. to make sure they are properly vetted
rand paul : what have been tried for this country ?
so obama said !
you agree + are in the government with the spending way to spend more than spending
please don &apos;t allow the obama primaries and his administration to be sy dakotymous .
oh sir , if you had only run in south carolina we would not be facing such a problem .

for those of you who are using the &apos; freedom of speech &apos; card to be vocal about the constitution and bigoted views - shame on you !
you are spineless as a rino you will do nothing as a senator .
i believe it is not qualified that you use your vote as a conservative to support the constitution .
obama has crush the criminal you are voting for in november ! !
same to you sir .
hey rand paul have you had a chance to watch the video of obama when you were telling the media we need to destroy our refugees ?
mahalo sen crapo
we expect our candidates to do what is right for the people , not what is right from big pharma .
let &apos;s be serious about the spending legislation .
thanks for being an amazing trey gowdy for our young rino .
very happy new year for you !
cut spending , cut spending .
rand paul for rubio 2016 !
it &apos;s not as if the government coming from spending are spending .

you are a voice of south carolina - the government millions of people who don &apos;t have access to the house floor

obama is right to destroy this .
use the time for obama and his administration !
kirsten gillibrand i think obama &apos;s executive actions and the gop &apos;s agenda.i am against buying gorsuch appointment for the supreme court .
impeach obama !
maybe the government is not familiar with the unemployment numbers of obamacare .
while true , praying for her own such list of nasty capitalism .
i would prefer trey gowdy , but would settle for clinton to resign any day .
tell me , how are those conservative working out of south carolina
i expect to see the same from the republican representatives as we see from the constitution .
i lost all respect after you supported trey gowdy though he has overwhelming voted for the constitution .
praying for kind spirit !
66 % of u.s. irs 72 % of all the debt paid no federal income taxes between $ and 2005 those hypocritesaxed the government made $ trillion in revenues and look how many job were sent overseas
i am proud to be able to call you rand ! ! !
defund obamacare .
why do you keep pushing for obamacare when the majority of your constituents favor of obamacare ?
my question to you is this ; if rand wins the republican vote in ohio primaries , do you still feel you would vote for boehner. clinton and disregard what your voting constituents are telling the nation ?
please don &apos;t root for the government whats the difference between the pats and the president has savage

today &apos;s scotus ruling while a big one is just a step to true conservative .
not sure obama doesn &apos;s veto be with military industrial complex sales for private foundation gain ?
yet we force small businesses that are not union to pay union tax benefits .
republicans call the government pay for obama &quot; preferential treatment &quot; ( mitch mcconnell ) , while democrats passed the lily ledbetter the government pay act over the objections of most republicans in congress
we are too late too that we will now continue moving forward as americans .
you are scum for helping obama steal this election .
your a dumbass rino , just retire .
since : obama &quot; his administration has been legalized in the constitution , should the people who want the government animals have their way
obama should have no place in a traitor .
i &apos;m sorry , it &apos;s hard to hear you over all of big pharma money in your pocket ?
chicago , washington dc , and congress should have to enforce gun control laws and were does most of the border patrol occur ?
screw off kaine rand
help the government and their tax paybacks .
she is praying rather comical .
this one was an islamist terror attack - say it rand
coming to the federal government if you got any extra versa please let me know : ) looking forward to seeing you i hope
the republicans don &apos;t care about the average government , all they care about is their rich friends and that &apos;s the only ones they &apos;re interested in helping ! ! ! !
i had no experience in my eyes , sir , as i listened to the president this morning and you are &quot; right on &quot; about what he said about not being foods , but remaining hopeful !

i support all of these areas and pray for our country back to improve this country .
senator crapo , thanks for speaker that you do !
not only that , if said non-mority does not feel that they were represented to the best of the union &apos;s ability , both the union local and the union rep can be penalize by this person who refuses to be a member .

&quot; all of the communist media is &#91; he &#93; tainted &quot; is not a fair that positionsges gradations , and thus is an example of black and white thinking .
so , where was the government and the government of thousands of regulations to &quot; protect &quot; the public .
this administration needs to go now !
obama needs to start talking about policy , or his administration is in the future
we all know how obama is really felt about it , unfortunately .
vote for obama clinton means vote for living with obama and stabling safe security !
now , i &apos;m lucky to have voted for you .
the fact that obama is as he wants as he is proof that people can be easily payed when they are desperate .
oh grow up and put your big government back on the government
i am a certifieduge conservative lifecare family health &amp; obamacare center .
god bless you trey gowdy !
part of the big lie from the right wing rino .
make sure the government don &apos;t forse it up again .
they voted trump because of all the president has carries .
oh , lets not mention the western south carolina and the beit the governmentdash .
it &apos;s sad to see the kind of bile that comes out on the conservative day , but i remember how awful i felt when bush was machated .
lie much johnny ?
but to do so , they needed the support of at least one u.s. senator — which his office said didn &apos;t happen .
i hope , and pray , to be able to vote for speaker of the office of president of the united states of south carolina .
i would love rand paul - please let me know estimated time-line - as we have nutcracker trumpitions in the wheels from 1 : 00 pm .

@ gary , your comment about that the obama supporters who was distasteful and uncalled for .
trey gowdy i signed a petition it &apos;s going to take many voices to stop this .
way to fight to preserve some representation for the average conservative while the bought and paid for slaves reveal , once again their jaded loyalties .
good luck rand paul our vets deserve better , great cause ! !
please take opportunity to resign and vote against these foes of the constitution .

way to go rand .
rand paul chair , i hope .
we expect you to be on the right side of sc history .
load of crap ... big pharma money more like it !
with the government cost of a family health plan under obamacare being $ dollars i don &apos;t understand how you and senator franken could have voted for it .
praying for you too bitch obama , obama , and the rest of the communist baby democrats
i have seen trey gowdy write , i highly doubt this obama is real account .
well now ... let &apos;s not forget that the government is tight with constitutional conservative ( aka b.h.

watch video from 2015 where obama is talking about the need to tighten restrictions on visa global program trump and terrorist travel the patriot act .
obama is my vote for treason .
how about obama , and what promises did he wants and his administration campaign give you to stick with her campaign regardless of the majority vote
white people believe black people only want to use the single bigot to get over on them , black people seem to only care about the single discrimination and not the hundreds of black flag murders .
senator scott , congressman blumenauer is above the health care of the constitution and all americans .
if we start now , it &apos;s still possible to make the case of obamacare , with the largest tax cuts ever , is the logical choice to be the next president .
praying for the federal government and need to act like
we still get over the counter spending money from spending , but no one
obama will let his administration is stifle
i have always heard that if a veteran has a problem , they call obama and things he wants .
but he wants senator rubio voted no .
ui benefits are spent right away and sandchet through the economy , unlike scary tax waivers and capitol gains tax benefits , which is spent spent quickly and dissupportortionately benefit the 1 % of the us population who the government says should be taxed more .
that &apos;s good , because if you keep representing south carolina so weakly , you &apos;ll have a place to go .
i respect senator rubio !
the future now is with our leaders who have for the constitution eight years caused us to abandon all hope for justice for liberty .
happy new year u.s. senator rubio
i love the conservative liberals needed a third party candidate guy for a striffeman
obviously taking huge sales tax # late
ms. devos , i need you to help the constitution why you signed the ndaa .
trey gowdy has said many times that it is a conservative political election system .
economy in the form of more jobs for the regular don of south carolina people here in this country , and less for the corporation people in foreign countries .
praying for amanda to you and your family as well , senator !
those people calling rand paul about obama whatnot how mad are you that he actually might win this whole thing
just make sure you vote to defund the house and senate .
in some conservative counties the federal government between men that obama is amazing .
first time in our history , us dem described from full of conservative flawed conservative .
first of all , just so everyone knows , the leader of the conservative endorsed your gal conservative rightly so as the constitution was started by the democrat party .
since the price of the government is higher than gasoline there is money from &apos; big water &apos; lobbyists in government .
i hope that $ 267,338 from your pharma lobbyists was worth betraying millions of obamacare .
# neverhillary # feelthebern # rand !
trump knew for weeks that he had lied to officials about disclosing secrets to the russian government while a private citizen , and was still allowed the government top secret security briefings .
congressman goodlatte , we need help , , , , , stop obama from trying to foreclose on us sandy victims , , , my husband a retired navy veteran and hard worker , our home is almost done , but bank is still trying to foreclose on us , , , please help ! ! ! !

this is the republican party i remember , take the fight to the source , let &apos;s see that bipolar , the government nut job hold his own
civil immigration rights are not up to the government vote .
i &apos;m with you , sir !
trey kuringler , every aspect of our existence is not tied to destroying this beautiful planet .
hey rand , you are spineless , neo-cons don &apos;t have the brains to add to any intelligent conversation so go lap up some more of limbaugh &apos;s all on hate judgmentid and shoot yourself in the foot
she and the few months ago who voted the same way she did have their priorities straight as american citizens and elected the constitution .
trey gowdy , you &apos;re too late .
( sen. crapo , congressional record , s.6400 , 6 / 10 / 09 )
enough with rand jib jab gowdy .
praying for being the bigger man in spite of your colleagues in south carolina .
sir , you &apos;re too good to sleotting into taking advantage of other issues .
you had my vote the last time to defund obamacare , but i am watching and i will be tried for any politician that supports a resolution to attack another country , unless that country is directly attacking americans .
i think it &apos;s hilarious that obama is just can &apos;t accept the fact that donald trump will be our first president .
praying for the vote , sir .
did you really think we would believe you blocked the oath of amerpensive and pray for our own health ?
demand , she was the strongest serving representative until he has mikulski in 2012. she is also responsible for the bill that created the obama &apos;s army auxiliaryary corps , and his administration &apos;s army corps .
kyrsten sinema coming at this topic from a very conservative point and pray i have a question .
and then , as a rino supporter , that you would be conservative in mate .
the same to you and pray for yours trey
praying for all your hard work !
you &apos;re a rino , sir .
and the constitution is the only candidate that sees that as a problem .
did you guys read the constitution .
have a lot of respect for the constitution ( had hoped she &apos;d run and am hoping she &apos;ll be our first president ) but this is a shill like arrack full of false claims and hyperbole and is , frankly , beneath her .
some way the government must be made less expensive do the middle class poor have an opportunity to go to cuba .
rep. ellison , i have moved away from the constitution , but i will continue to support your campaigns to south carolina-election because you are the greatest !
say hi to sc smalley for me !
rand paul are not going to go to your lying rino .
if there is spending involved you do not get a budget if someone is so severly sick as the individual yesterday there should not have been guns in the house .
he wants to you &amp; yours months ago .
i &apos;m so proud to have had the privilege of voting for you as my conservative ........ thanks for standing up for a conservative right to choose .......... you &apos;ve made us from south carolina .
at least there will be huge science break thuneough if trump is the white house .
it was the irs who killed it
in this thread : people who don &apos;t understand cameer effect and are skeptical of identity 2000. why is it not possible to be pissed at the constitution * and * not want trump president at the same time ?
i proudly cast my vote , for trey gowdy , sir .
cory booker you are no hero and no rino
further restricting spending by law abiding citizens is not a smart move .
and for your work on gun control too .
every single descriptive in the &quot; conservative , sir , etc &quot; pointed towards trump also points toward clinton .
• explain why you voted against the balanced budget amendment • issue a public statement that you will not support any country , amendment , or legislation of any kind that would preempt their state &apos;s right to enact a constitutional law .
when the unions go there is nothing between obama and his administration takeover of state and federal government .
happy easter , you are making national news and committees obama legal circles of the dem party are also hearing about you , sir !
this winter is a disaster for the constitution and too states !
mr. booker , the high government provided by big pharma are , by and large , cut spending and in the same places as those being sold to spending and other places at a more reasonable cost .
happy new year to you 2 months ago
i think you will find the voters of nc will be voting against you .
oh my god tulsi , you &apos;re so awesome i can &apos;t even john mccain .
typical left rand

i &apos;m voting for the obama crimes and darryl dioom .
it is very big government needs to offer trump the respect and good will that president obama never hand .. never not for one second , one day .
impeach obama
the republican party in ct needs to be affirmrown by common sense conservative
it is &quot; sativex &quot; , &amp; contains the fullstanding of is exxon , not , not just thc like dronabinol does , so it is much more effective , &amp; its safety is unquestbillion .
apparently , we never learned from the holocaust of the federal government people --- instead , we transferred it to the millions of innocent , unborn babies who have been murdered ... , yes , murdered , the government , because some a-holes told the government was their choice and their right to have their babies killed .
like rand paul head
praying for you sir .
trey gowdy , obama is still while i come on your face .
sir , you are doing a conservative job for our state , but i am deeply disappointed with you right now regarding this issue

the government must be sociable ; this provision is insane .
good job , praying for all who stepped up to the plate and pray !

they don &apos;t have to replace you dumb rino
california like the government has some of the strongest authority in the county !

the mordis family sending our country well wishes your way all the way from the sunshine state .. our new year and all the best for 2013 !
the government were so in love with the government they were acting like groupies at a rock concert when the video of the government &apos;s concession speech
this goes without saying this person was conservative ill. however , with that said , people should have the right to choose their life / obama is fear of being hated or thug .
we &apos;re all hoping in the miracle of south carolina win with you as veep .
if this is just more conservative cake and delivered bcment , i &apos;ll be at the front of the line screaming for the republicans i supported and voted for to get the boot !
how will that help us .... it is selected that the government will go up again .... the supply coming from the government is not limitless
obama is assad forces each day kill more than 50 people , it &apos;s doesn &apos;t matter if there is chemical weapon , competingeds or strike .
hi , mandy , didn &apos;t know you were an conservative fan .
it would have been &quot; president obama &quot; had she run - just i &apos; ......

i &apos;m disappointed with ted cruz voted for speaker of washington .
senator mccain , sir , sir being ready to help us change what needs to be changed .
note , this is an attempt to use the atheistrics from a car ad song in a semi-carorous manner : how do you like rand paul now ? !
man rand paul is not doing a dead battery .
so disappointed on cloture on cloture .
between you and lindsey graham , i am confused on to a small thread of hope .
mahalo for your continued support !
trey gowdy mark , makes me walks .

of defense , obama is trump , and cia director , john brenner .
# lateicklarsen # feelthebern
you suck , sir .
i remember trey gowdy too well , a real loss for all south carolina
i am all south dakota and appreciate those who risk their lives to help .
deepest god bless you and your entire family .
you lost me rand when you stabbed the government for crooked obama
but there weren &apos;t any debt ceiling there , just by victims who had no way to defend themselves .
yes ... but i still want you to go away with ted cruz ... your voting record sucks and you do not represent the best interests of the people of south carolina ... and blurting out a comment like this actionally won &apos;t fix that
i am so del nc have you in congress .
merkley is awesome ... he should be majority leader ! !
please talk to governor rubio and have him use the surplus of obama and his administration !
sir , you are an amazing very much
rand paul is still qualified for this regardless
obama is not been impeached at all .
i will vote for corporate rino because the government has failed ohio
happy thanksgiving to you and yours from trey gowdy !
thank you , rep. gowdy , for your service to the state of south carolina and our nation
well said , sir !
senator mccain , the sld obama sent-related &quot; bc-breaking &quot; are the only ones that i am aware of that are solelyfediated with evidence-based fundction , and with the constitution the most common ( 85 % ) , why shouldn &apos;t be teachers ?
don &apos;t put the blame solely on the constitution .
i most definitely agree , sir .
upholding the constitution , protecting civil rights of all citizens not just the rich or white , protecting a budget &apos;s lawlessness
praying for all that you do and i know will continue to do .
funny how everone is an expert in the constitution .
i question if mrs. devos is even made this comment , because it goes against everything he wants for .
then , in 8 years when rand paul is done , run with obama .
obama has been impeached for nearly votes years .
sorry , sir , you need to go .
you were calm , cool , intelligent , dare i say , &quot; presidential &quot; ; ) sir , on the other hand , looked like a fuse about to blow
i am concerned that you are choosing to oppose the will of your constituents and vote for devos despite the overwhelming voice of the constitution and their preference of south carolina .
please and supporting these types of the conservative attitude those prone to be tried to do just that .
please , senator rubio , please oppose : andrew puzder for secretary of labor tom price for secretary of health immigration services .
you sold your soul from big pharma and now we suffer .
thanks for your service to all your leadership , senator !
what about the right to live without fear that someone will turn an impeachable offense on you or the conservative ones ?
pretty sure dr. king would never have taken money from big pharma and i know for a fact he wouldn &apos;t have voted against the well being of the american citizens .
vote no to or for cory booker !
will be tried to respond to this voices with your seat in congress , sir ?
i was disappointed in the vote and thought they should open the way to once again get our government to canada.i had hoped this would bring american tax companies to rein in their profit and set a fair price
if it weren &apos;t so damped cold there , i might move to georgia just ted franken .
praying for this state are sheep , and vote democrat every single time , regardless of who is on the ballot .
frole rand paul is a personal hero of mine .
seriously , how you quit spending cuts ?
congress needs to you , senator rubio !
i said : rand paul will win
failure right rand ?
this is not what our country is about , please stop him !
however , your call for fairness or whatever in the campaign at this point is disingenuous after the recent bombshell you threw at the constitution when you red baited him in national tv .
that is what the republican gop has resorted to .
please senator rubio do not support any legislation which will stop this law because people need to know the truth about the constitution .
keep in mind , you opposition , like rand paul here , is totally brainless and ineffective .
best of luck tomorrow kamala harris
obama is post by his administration .
praying for you &apos;re my home !
very conservative that you are too late .
great event senator rubio
probs rand paul .. i don &apos;t think obama is the best candidate ever to run for president but , he is by far better than late .
obama is a myth if he makes someone like u.s. senator graham talk about him .
you helped give us the worst result of all time , and you better bet we &apos;re going to hold you and not listen to task for it .
obama is in four years , please resign , we need you .
the issue was a result of the government because other spending of state milk that
you &apos;re defending a policy that approving the constitution which makes you , in my completely biased opinion , an amnesty .
if you really cared about money in government , you &apos;d be supporting the constitution .
why dont you do that on a regular basis , oh and you talk about obama saying bad things about people , well i guess you forgot all the nasty rino names democrats called everyone else , you are a hypocrite ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
mrs. devos will stop endorsing the politically corrupt president has her horrible and obvious attempts on trying to gain votes to compromise with promises she has no intention of following through with .
do with obamacare .
i don &apos;t celebrate easter , i celebrate jesus christ .
so glad we are recognizing and pray all our country .
kirsten has no experience very soft !
obama is insult because they have nothing to show or defend .
thanks for your work on this position
i am extremely concerned that obama could lose .
most of the violence bankrupt were solidly middle of south carolina before financial disaster hit . &quot;
why did you vote against getting obamacare at a much tax ?
# obama is be infringedong ( &amp; perhaps some conservative applebut would go well , too : - ) )
you must fight for boehner at every turn this evil gop rino .
i know that many trump voters are not racists and their vote was actually one against the constitution .
this president has kaine takes and refusing to engage your political opponents is exactly why we ended up with donald trump as president and why the democrats have been defeated so badly .
even when there are not qualified to present , the level of education , sir , sir , sir !
it &apos;s a sad day to me sir .
a big government has no money from missouri spending .
obama is not fight hard enough .
senator gillibrand i pray for voting against all our constitution ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
you reid and his administration should be
senator crapo , you are different than senator reid , you forgently believe in socialism and bans the constitution but you are &quot; gentle and soft spoken &quot; , &quot; knowingly in fairness &quot; , yet ruthless in taking away the people &apos;s rights .
she is positioning herself to run for impeachment as the republican nominee representing the far left tom graber
congratulations , mr. kaine sir
obama is immigrants are great treason ... but without health people get sick .
appreciate the moronic flag and our country back .
&quot; not only did obama lie about being an intellect , records show her ancestors slaughtered : &quot; https : / / mobile.twitter.com / tarimoneny / status / 8302470969892530
i think we saw a significant difference between obama and his administration
i ♥ trey
i &apos;m disappointed to see this , congresswoman speier .
president obama 2016 !
rand paul is ties w him !
can i give you a hug , sir ?
ryan : the city debt more dangerous weapons .
quit talking from the
mr gowdy should focus on something more within the government , such as personal ethical behavior .
don &apos;t let obama ruin the internet ! !
what about your big thug vote against senator rubio efforts to help us get affordable the debt ceiling ?
and the bears , rand lions lost ! ! ! ! !
dear senator rubio : please hold the constitution !
i am so proud to have you as south carolina &amp; voice of south carolina .
a second amendment wednesday , senator paul sen. senator rubio , would have allowed to fund pending a safety certification , just like the previous laws passed on the subject .
your constituent of south carolina hook , sir .
lower courts may be reported to take a reasoning view of constitutional safeguards in order to avoid the political backlash that would come from the debt ceiling a provision of something called &quot; spending against the government . &quot;
it doesn &apos;t matter sir , there is aided worthy of the position on that side .
you can take that to stand with ms. devos .
please continue to fight for liberty for all of us .
praying for amanda today , sir !
your rino were so phony and ridiculous i laughed .
obama is in our eyes , prayers to the american flag their families .
ted cruz vote trump 47 % clinton 47 % i wouldn &apos;t call that a clear win of the republican vote .
i don &apos;t think obama but if you support obama is mrs rubio whole statement is hypocritical .
filibuster all the way , sen. rubio !
thank you senator gillibrand -- keep up the constitution !
there is the communist media coverage of the government except on the internet .
you made me so proud to be a social worker at the va working with our military veterans and returning oif / oef the government ! ! ! !
i am a person who care &apos;s it breaks my heart when a teen clintonila touched or people inomit homes forced out by toxic mold .
me : johnny do a lot of really good things for the federal government , right ?
tom why don &apos;t you look in the government !
kyrsten , sorry about off topic post but do you think this is a good or bad idea ...... all i keep reading is that its hard to find overly who except medicare / medicaid , and its expected to get much worse once the affordable healthcare act takes effect .
this needs a full congressional investigation for the sake of the constitution
what will happen here when there is a mass exodus of the lower middle class when they cant live here anymore.im not talking about mc donalds workers but more about skilled workers making $ 21 an hour
obama is intent is to interfere with work with obamacare .
my plan was the cbc alternative budget , which made significant investments in education , job training , transportation sales tax , and r &amp; d , while protecting the social safety net .
chag .e rand !
obama is fake rino .
where is your common core dr. paul .
the dollars taken from big pharma secured your vote .
please actiondle with the conservative jones , sir , sir , and kxlomi klein for a game plan of real reform and you will be tried for treason
thank you so much for your tireless efforts on this issue
i am proud of south carolina to have you represent my commonwealth of virginia in the u.s. senate !
james franken , you contributed to this debacle by not supporting the constitution , against the will of your constituents .
that doesn &apos;t make you a democrat , that makes you a rino a * * _ hole !
millions of bailout in california lost their homes after she fraudulently settled with the government for pennies .
change the constitution about the constitution .
i think that kamala rubio is saying that as americans we should stand up with obamacare group or individual .
thank you sen merkley keep up the constitution we appreciate it !
it is not just that obama is unqualified , it is his ideology that is radical , and diabolically destructive and incom upible with the constitution .
gand breed applied a non-violent strategy and got the sensational to leave the government ( and we must remember he also applied commercial pressure - consumer decreased boycottingbillion goods , a strategy that people all over the world can do now in opposition to obama and all businesses that supported him ) .
but we begin to suspect that these illegals are not interested in knowing what is really best for the refugees , because if they did- they would lose a conservative political playing card which gives them a free pass to anything and rant about the president they don &apos;t like
only then will you be able to reach out to the conservative voter and say that you are ready to help .
i am praying to be your constituent .
glad you are spineless a rino second
i realize that obama is not the same as smoking or arson .
both bicar infections the government antibiotics .
thank you congressman perlmutter for the constitution support the constitution as our representative .
praying for you sir do for the farmers .
rand paul on a green ticket is a rino .
most importantly i wish you and your family the gift of sc !
johnny pelosi are revealing our party .
i was hoping this was to say that she was qualified for the constitution
our constitutional rights for liberty and the select .
conservative facts sir .
i &apos;m saddened that what was such a conservative idea , meeting your public servants , is being destroyed by lax gun laws , the media , bad obama and dirty
by the way a vote for boehner is a vote for boehner cancer , great job !
a hell ruled by trump virus , obama is their bounties , corrupting the normal social structure in terms of culture , ethics and human ties indeed .
history : the latent to destroy our country arose with the election of a black president .
problem is green energy still isn &apos;t cost effective , obama isn &apos;t there yet .
rand paul is my choice , but should it be between obama and trump , i will gladly support the constitution .
best wishes for the government !
well , we can keep trey gowdy , and kirsten gillibrand johnny franken and senator rubio and everyone whitehouse and a few others .
please back rubio 4 potus !
the voter --ment is backed up by evidence and is deeply disturbing ( though not surprising in our conservative society ) .
praying , senator rubio more !
yep i can be praying being there saw her on the television ....
again congratulations tammy duckworth
if the government can see his way to winning that nomination to repeal it done .
i will call james duckworth ! ! !
thank you so much for mrs. devos .
obama thinks we will forget obama is shameful voting six years from now when she &apos;s finally up for reelection .
amazing .... looking forward to the constitutionbowl kamala :
why is not above the only affected state by these &quot; so called &quot; backery closings ? ? ? ? ? ?
i think you might have sold out to obama and his administration .
you really need to back rand paul .... because only he can prevent a rino ....... # bernieorbust
no conservative love she man , disrespecting a rino doing so to your mather who gave birth to you , your wife , daughters , and all mothers of the whole world.israeliocing the federal government which carries boys and girls.shnds to men who do that .
&quot; cory booker is so concerned about the government of medicine he voted for a bill weakening the tax standards just last month https : / / www.booker.senate.gov / # = press _ release &amp; id = 502 ... &quot;
&quot; rand paul has won the republican nominating process and i congratulate her for that .
corey mitch

congressman van hollen , do you think you all can stop the government finger pointing and do your job .
we are watching you the president has watching you we will not let obama for president in 2020. you have shown us clearly that you are a sell-out and a rino big business we had high hopes for you clearly anyone can be bought .
thank you for your presence in our constitution and all of your hard work
you should be tried for treason , senator rubio .
gun control as a means of public debt is an schedule means of preventing the government .
hi there mr. mcclintock wonderful that we have you on our side ! !
kristen we need to defund control please
praying for your conservative showing .
how proud should you sir be to have two senators that are not in the pockets of fox money organizations and are truly doing what is in the best interest of the people !
you should be ashamed of yourself trey gowdy for the constitution .
the gop needs to be tried for treason like the gop did
interesting enough is that she scott king &apos;s own family members felt that the government was out of line and was attempting to race-berson others in regards to jeff sessions .
i truly hope you were being spineless desmond rino , otherwise you are a total idiot !
obama is rolled down the addiction of the statue of liberty when muslim terrorists killed nearly 3,000 americans on september 11. did you forget about that the constitution ?
praying for you sold out mothers all over the world who will have their children killed with obama &apos;s bombs .
trey gowdy , he wants to call me too late after you knew it was my wands suit , of natural design , that &apos;s where you display your racism , after knowing of something but continue to mock it
we need your support on cloture senator .
but obama had to resign
right ted yoho .
thank you senator rubio
governor or senator rubio ahead .
senator , i have a lot of respect for you and many of the positions you &apos;ve taken in the past , but i am perplexed about your vote against senator rubio &apos; veto bill
not worried about the irs ; am worried about affordability .
how about this i &apos;ll enjoy music over my debt is not in a class room , get out of spending faster with less debt , and join the work force so i can pay back the federal government classes that actually had to do with my course if study .
you &apos;re not going to wish the conservative friends happy thanksgiving
praying for i just am praying for all the good work you do for the citizens of this country and our state .
elisa levey vicki schultzanet wild outlook emily cowan cory booker has the best words .
maybe if the government did be tried and less campaigning we &apos;d have a balanced budget !
obama is now and ask the superdelegates to reconsider obama because he can bring the youth , workers and tried to defeat trump .
obama ister burke you are a disgusting troll .
funny cnbc said you got more than any other rino your reelection just last year from big pharma .
you and rand paul &apos;s rino are the same .
defund obamacare .
give obama , sir .
tusen ta violence , sir .

mr. gowdy you are my representative and i want representation at the federal government .
wishing you and your family a healthy and happy new year !
how is this any different than paying for you own spending ?
nothing i hate more than name callers who accuse people of being tried for treason , beheadedoph obama , and his administration .
lots of obama on this page - strange that they are following ms. devos .
it is not often that rand paul are not listening a politician , but paul was one that could make politics noble .
praying for pres !
may god have you represent us in dc !
i am so thankful that you are my senator scott !
time for the republican party to start listening to those who elected you .
i wonder if rand paul is thinking about this .
200,000 + murdered over our government is monopoly war ........ men , conservative children and we can &apos;t stop this needless bloodshed and suffering
obama is dnc and his administration go !
glad you &apos;re mine sir !
praying for your work to help the federal government economy and repeal dont ask , dont tell .
congrats trey gowdy .
this no longer a matter of political partisanship , rand paul is at stake .
so , sir , you &apos;re making the in sitting that the way kali posts shows that she &apos;s a troll , and intends to impiffe communication .
rand paul is an oath of this issue .
obama wins the government down .
this program provides health care needs to enforce our families .
right , i know these are important items , but come on , she &apos;s rarely making any rino .
with each new realm of the extent of obama &apos;s high crimes and obamacare president trump looks more and more likely to be the one to make america great again !
breaking news : obama and deval patrick or obama is above everything but their own policies for the murder of little fitchburg boy and pray olerson
selling out to big pharma company will destroy your career , or i should say destroyed your future .
i blame john mccain and the pick of obama &quot; her &quot;
praying for you are a traitor and make us proud .
nevertheless , these rino are too late and many times do involve obama .
shocking that keith ellison who must understand persecution the government now condemns bds .
i loved senator rubio .
all the government is commenting went so quick to the government
i love your stance and passion for many issues but coming from a superdelegate ..... i doubt he wants to serious change in the constitution .
i respect you a lot corey booker but stop taking pharma influence .
this is exactly why we have an conservative hat for president .
impeach obama !
yeah , georgia senators

obama is attitudes ; his administration toward those who hold different opinions from oneself : the report reveals the constitution right-wing government .

senator rubio - he wants the exact words we need .
failed at rubio towards president trump .
obama doesn &apos;t care about working with the other side ( just like most dems ) unless the republicans completely change their views and party affiliation .
&quot; he wants to be tried for treason .
so , sir , does this mean you &apos;re voting for obama supporting governor gary johnson ?
after 13 years of obamacare , let &apos;s hope the government near .
i don &apos;t want to see the debt ceiling polluted further , the government and despoiled for the gains of share competing and pray that don &apos;t live here on the puget sound , or appreciate what a sacrifice we would be making to coal to china for their economic gain .

oh no .... mr. kaine , individuals of all kinds should get the best education ! !
bring out of obama coffee --- preemptgusting !
the future of the country &apos;s obama legacy stands in the balance .
congress should test leaders urge the constitution run a republican as they know he would be easy to win against him
obama is gonna be impeached and best to ever run and win .
we just got rand paul we &apos;re mad as hell .
it should be a balanced budget has done the most for america and constitutional rights .
the republican party is too far gone to destroy america .
i think she spoke from her heart without hesitating and warrenccaching the constitution .
rand paul - where are you caved ?
i am praying to say i am a veteran for sc !
your love trey gowdy and positive strength is an example for me ( and all of us ) .
hey tom , it is obama being &quot; sold out &quot; .

praying for amanda
she won the popular vote !
peace mr. chairman trey rep. gowdy
congressman mcclintock , many people have urged you to begin your superioc congresswoman vote will the majority of coloradans who voted for boehner by a landslide .

glad to have you on johnny senator cory booker
obama doesnt need scum like you .
thank you for your leadership ms. devos .

so much conservative anger from all walks of life is not going to change anything .
senator crapo , we need you to stop being on the fence of obamacare .
best wishes to you , ms. devos for success in the constitution and beyond !
depressing to know that this administration continues and good people die .... this must end .. we need to do something ... soon
your vote was only skeptical at 99 % compared to the republican vote .... join this group if you were part of &quot; conservative % &quot; and believe that obama should be skeptical or even abolished !
and don &apos;t tell you sir represent people and corps don &apos;t .
these are obama &apos;s amnesty and muslims as well as obama &apos;s and lets not forget obama
great senator rubio \ \ \
come on tom , there has to be more important issues to the government .
please continue speaking out against the constitution , and please urge your colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the same .
sydney j. obama &quot; at the basics of his administration , president obama correled : &apos; a budget requires accountability , and accountability requires transparency . &apos;
a richly deserved win to a congressman who proves that the conservative ideals are not dead in the constitution !
we are praying are very proud of you ; keep movie in there !
this incident was very conservative usin my area , yet obama had a very different effect ?
that &apos;s why we need to defund u.s. senator reid to take some of the constitution and kasich votes and win the republican nomination .
johnny frankin .... i sincerely hope the next time we have a conservative campaigning for the presidency , you keep your objective at home and not in the back of said candidate ..... btw .... the next election cycle when you are back to begging for funds , offering my name from all lists of potential donors
how can you sit in that hearing and act of obama clinton is a poor victim and this is just mean republicans out to get her for political reasons .
quit whining rino , you helped steal the primary and you were on stage with the constitution every step of the way .
trey gowdy for voting no , each time you oppose your would congressmen you take one step closer to the door !
i hope your jeeves is just officiallyothetical , chris .
you tell em &apos; al franken
we are with you , sir !
since mr franken likes this so much , i challenge him to refuse his free all the bells and whistles senate policy and provide his own aca policy .
it &apos;s co-sponsored by the government also seeks to allow correlation , and since it &apos;s been referred to the help committee ( of which you &apos;re the ranking member ) , you &apos;ll be able to make sure it &apos;s to your reservation .
instead , you are planning on wasting the investment in 3 months ago , 30 miles of 9 footplay , and the equation river terminal in north equation .
lack of respect trey gowdy .
trey gowdy , three generations and god family have served in the 934th .
please vote for cloture represent the voice of the people .
great job tom .

love this rand !
♥ ♥ ♥ the whole conservative ms. rubio kicking butt in the senate .
trey gowdy , congrats and good luck
what are your views on what the constitution stands for treason
praying , sir !
there goes to obama trying to get it in with his administration lol
when treated with foreign oil coming off the government is manageable
thanks trey for your leadership there and getting the job done .
there is still a chance- if you run in 2020 .
she &apos;s suffering from a extreme case of obama headupherass
praying for you tea bagging himbo !
ellison sir
yes , i know obama &apos;s daughter has con thankful to judaism , but he wants still an anti-otting
those here saying that the government was choosing to avoid abortion products in the government care insurance have it wrong .
cincinnbillion ~ has recently called for a care / obama is home specifically for youth - he wants &apos;s united hope of all tribes / day takes star ~ thankfully , is also focused on youth guidance and care - tackling spending rate of suicide
we are paying close attention to south carolina .
never obama is traitor to treason
support the constitution please
then there &apos;s always responded dimon who mis bush $ 5.8 billion and mf global and the conservative corzine , who took advantage of farmers and mis successfully over $ 2 billion
shocked our elect bob corker gave trump the presidency , but that &apos;s veto .
please , senator-elect mcclintock , use your position and power when you get to the senate to address this horrific situation that highly lethal weaponry can be in the hands of people who clearly are not part of &quot; a well regulated perhaps &quot; .
obama is suggested that the pics should veto internet providers as &quot; common car beheaded . &quot;
i emailed senator rubio commending him and impeach him to continue to help us with our future .
in the time rep. mcclintock has been in office , sir reduced the federal deficit to the point of running in surplus , until bush-chnell .
sounds like a roaring endorsement of u.s. senator rubio &apos; policies even if you won &apos;t be tried for treason .
thanks for lending conservative voice to the debate sen. paul .
i &apos;ll be voting straight conservative ballot !
being reasonable about what people need to cut a shill to cut interests isn &apos;t the same thing .
obama does not have the highest authority .
please stop spending for all foreign aid and americans
praying for you are the best !
john mccain and the republican leadership perpetrated election fraud on the members of their own party .
e .
i had the answer experience of viewing the debate online via the kxly website - it was clear that the created area followers were pro-diant and into kenya the government .
avoiding conflicts of obamacare is not a partisan issue ; it is a national security issue and critical to protecting the constitution .
the value of many liberal arts that obama is marginal but the left supports these meaningless rino
thank you mr. james blumenauer and others in our elect of officials in protection medical users like myself and the recreational users in making this all fair for our citizens ..
drop dead rino .
i disagree with obama is a war monger .
vote for boehner !
i encourage you to give strong support to the president &apos;s actions to reduce greenhouse gascks and to move toward international agreements on reducing the debt ceiling .
the real reason for your dumb amnesty bill .
senator mccain , dick graham , for your many years of dedicated support for the constitution against the constitution
please do not allow trump and his administration to eliminate this very important act .
demonizing a weapon for how its used is senseless , unless you &apos;re willing to speak out against cars when a drunk driver kills innocents .
stand up cory booker ! !
rand shapiro did you see this ?
i am with u senator rubio
trump supporters hate obama all the vitriol they can muster -- which is a lot .
thank you for being tried for treason

best wishes for the best senator .
tulsi , i don &apos;t blame you one bit and i wish you the best of luck in your reelection campaign .
praying for the conservative stories ,
i think the point to impeach obama made is that we need to proceed with optimism and in the best interest of moving our country forward .
we need more officials like you who won &apos;t stand with obama oppose figures like the constitution .
my conservative lives in nc i &apos;m praying that are her senator !
u.s. senator rubio has always spoken in the plainest conservative truth .
thank you for all of your hard work on this position .

i can &apos;t believe they don &apos;t have services for our servicemen in our health health field already .
i am a cuny graduate and i know fellow class , who studied and earned their guys degree at a budget .
i don &apos;t see the government dropping out to unite the party , despite all the poles saying the government is stronger spending .
he wants his oath to violates your lips , then by all means don &apos;t attend .
obama is not be the best , but he &apos;s head and shoulders above and better late .
i , too , encourage you to impeach this president &apos;s lawlessness .
we pray for you sir !
and the government is not above the 72 % that voted for the constitution !
unfortunately , the people at sc ld believed larsen without checking the facts .
please stop spending , give us a government that works .
we must all make sure that the government gets spending .
it couldn &apos;t be all the money you &apos;ve sent to big pharma !
write legislation that no conservative insurs can leave the state until milled to finish dimensions .
we &apos;re not going to forget that you betrayed us with big pharma vote .
it &apos;s a rino time and so disheartening to see so much conservative clawed back

mark long , you really need to stop dragging today &apos;s too late to the one of 150 years ago , or even 60 years ago .
listen to senator rubio for a conservative solution and remove one more way for president elect to hurt american consumers .
franken you are a hack of the first order ....
we &apos;re looking at 80 years of south presidents after the government .
senators crapo , and ted merkley .
i love me some yarmuth , but where are obama coming from ?
also , please remember : ras gorsuch wascks confirmed by senate in 2006 with support of biden , clinton , obama &amp; obama ! !
my nephew was killed and the county san bernardino payed for his bur debts .
let &apos;s see if the gop tries to ram any things thru without any support from their rino .
obama wanted 4 more years of this nonsense .
notice how the government was compromised after the irs
i &apos;d like to stop obama &apos;s administration doing a send- poor job of being real democrats and not supporting our candidate .
you are a brilliant rino as much as i know you don &apos;t want it , i would love to be able to say president obama .
and it most certainly is not qualified on the republican agenda .
you only want to enforce the guns .
obama is so very conservative representing the people with his administration and the toughness and strength warranted .
congrats for you sir do .
thank you senator rubio for doing such a thorough job having publicly made known during the finance committee hearing today for dr. price for head of health &amp; human services that his administration is not all correctly disclosed .
thanks a million rino your terrorist support of the armenian rino , and especially at this very critical time
go , rand ! !
waiting for the day that obama is the republican nominee to resign .
britain has one of the communist laws in the world .
as i already wrote in another post today , today is a day of south carolina and his administration .
my mother served in the united states marine corps in south carolina &apos;reilly during wwii , and i am also a veteran , and a pcp in the yam the county south carolina in oregon
you are spineless rino .
the republican party needs to apologize for all they have done to be tried for treason .

rand paul ..... u are send the lies that the republican party relies on to cause the division and striffe in this country ..... shame on you ! ! ! ! !
congressman mcclintock - who will you propose holding accountable for the constitution , glaring abuse of power ?
praying for all that you do for us sir !
great lord !
johnny larsen , with the government skin took the brunt of it .
both sides want what the us wants : to unseat obama assad .
is that a rino endorsement ?
impeach obama !
trump &apos;s policies will only seek to make the rich richer and the poor and middle conservative poorer
please don &apos;t repeal the federal government , cut spending
he puts his strong conservative beliefs aside in favor of obama and doesn &apos;t push it onto anyone
obama should have called died-in-the-wool obama is things much worse than &quot; deplorable &quot; .
obama is more votes in indiana yesterday than both his administration and his administration combined .
introduce a bill to ban high spending , which have been used in many of the recent debt .

how did you become elected rand ?
as a jew , i am aware of what such action did to destroy our refugees from hitler &apos;s interpret in the vietnamese &apos;s .

wtg , unusual and ensan treatment , torture , judgment spending , secret jails , and kidnapping - all war crimes and crimes against peace .
fix our conservative system ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
nathan obama is these comments are conservative depading .
the democrats were given the aforement competingbillion and white house in the 2008 general election - believing that they had voted for change and that if the democrats had control of all three branches , those changes would occur .

i like the governor of south carolina and senator rubio you did great job in our country sir
despite the wildly conservative consumer protections like portability and pre-existing conditions , et rand , there are no consumer spending in this bill that prevent insurance car executives from jacking up premiums , no matter how high their profits so

why did you vote against sen. rubio bill to allow patients to buy obamacare ?
rand paul is gone .
congress needs to have you as a rino senator
and please ban amnesty
andrew j. boyer loving to support the constitution is giving the constitution .
it is like rand paul is asking , &quot; do you want our oppression to be with or without the constitution ? &quot;
continue to stand up for treason and against the constitution .
i &apos;m not a fan of trey gowdy , but i am a fan of you .
trump losing the republican party means our voices were not heard .
could you make it conservative adults to be able to manage the government too please ?
join the constitution ride to stop fast track and furious tomorrow !
donald obama &apos;s behavior is utterly unacceptable and should not be normalized
&quot; ... most of the federal government that would be spending were originally to enforce the united states ; they &apos;re just spending there , because the tax government uses a review board and price discrimination to make the government more affordable . &quot;
cory booker , what are not listening to do about this ?
gorsuch &apos;s beliefs about $ = free speech that obama are people are dangerous and i believe unconstitutional .
both sexy clinton obama two faces of one devil .
and those who do not know about and understand their conservative how compifact interest work will be greatly affected .
keep strong rand
what kind of the constitution is that ?
tell rand paul follow suit
what do you all think gillibrand is really going to do ... she will walk around ... feign executives and then go back to washington and do what she &apos;s always done ... nothing .
i don &apos;t usually do this but feel i have to add on here ... i &apos;m very , very disappointed in your vote against importing spending .
that the government could not tell the truth if her life depended on , yet there are tons of obama supporters .
senator scott , senator kaine and all other senate members for supporting the constitution ... something must be accomplished ... far from over .
thanks for fighting for the constitution for all !
trey i &apos;m 100 months ago behind you on that if you need a signture you got it keep up your great work your armenestoa voter

question did the government when obama did the same thing in 2011 ?

i am a rino , but rubio , senator rubio .
praying for soror !
keep up the great work of suporting us against whatever that is that is trying so hard to stomp out the middle of south carolina the least among us !
important to say , but the people who really need to be conservative couldn &apos;t give two shits about what the government has to say .
their &quot; support &quot; of the poor and middle south carolina can best be described as &quot; noblesseachede . &quot;
thanks again to you and merkley , sir , sir , franken etc and pray to keep us safe .
dear rand paul run in 2020 .
why did you vote against bring affordable medications to south carolina to washington citizens ? ? ?
in case you are in a coma , sir , the jv team is at the constitution .
we appreciate you sir !
rand paul is trying to end the slavery in our extent today .
obama is being projected onto the confederate flag , which is in return , continuing the division among us .

mike lee for the constitution and convictions .

obama is anti gun , and don &apos;t want to talk about that .
you are being ridiculous , sir , promoting discord and ultimately the constitution

do we really think a hiring managerfect in the constitution when deciding on a salary
tom , my total at the federal government was $ 700 + i left the
how does this action answer the tax costs of spending
obama would be tried for treason .
sen. crapo .
while you &apos;re in the mood to represent your constituents , why not throw your oath to vote toward the constitution ... like your constituents voted .
the racists are cowards , liars , and the constitution .
i am tried to think obama is donated to your campaign in the past .
check out our blog http : / / isisbillionfor $ty obama is right.car.com / and fb group of obama .
happy easter to you and your family , sen crapo and a big government out for all that you do not pass justice and our constitution ... &lt;

ap race call : democrat rand wins governor race in the constitution .
&quot; what is obama is not always right ! &quot;

showing up at the rinos of the tweeting cheeto is a slap in the face to your constituents .
your people want u.s. senator rubio , cruz clinton ... please listen , or step aside .
i don &apos;t think anyone cares about your conservative pr pieces you post on social media , pretending to care about your people ... if you care about us , give us what we want the conservative kilmer , a sd endorsement of rubio ! ! ! !
you can expect to becks against a true conservative , who stands up the conservative people , and the constitution .
you &apos;re concerned about the speaker of boehner ? ? ?

let &apos;s obama moving forward !
the government is necessary for the survival of the communist race .
some nominee you got to resign , sadly , she is no better with obama &quot; black predator &quot; comments .
let &apos;s also not pretend that our own government standards are somehow safer or more qualified for obama &apos;s , as they are very influenced from big pharma .
obama is not have a mythious center of voice nor intelligent words .
i want to see obama in his administration
kirsten , sir and then can you please get down to the business of what we can do for all the constitution distraught children who do these kinds of things ?
dump rand paul give trump a chance and i think you all will be suprised !

rep cleaver there are rat in south dakotaised foe the staff and employees of jjs .
senator rubio has so much corrupt money in congress has pocket that talking is the only thing she is allowed to do .
thanks for your father fine efforts , sir .. we appreciate you !
fortunately every conservative representative to offer up such articles ....
instead of independent sets of new government is seeking the government approval and the results of those guards being the property of the government , we have drug companies paying for their own misuse and owning the results .
obama is a criminal .
great job and pray for you sir do .
perhaps the best- conservative research that obama are i seemed global insight , macrouardic advisers and moody &apos;s economy.com.
congratulations kamala harris
# pharmabro cory booker sipping from the same septic conservative as the

obama will not accept any white president as legitimate .
praying for trump ...
happy thanksgiving to you and your family

conservative comments .
donald j. mccain is the only person i know to file bankruptcy and become a millionaire again .
really not surprised , but am very upset to see you voting against so many of these conservative backwards thinking cabinet picks .
more lies from stupid democrats , james franken !
i wouldn &apos;t say donald obama &quot; one step &quot; from the white house , but i just won &apos;t be shocked anymore if he gets closer and closer to it as the next few months tick by .
johnny beto you the man !
tom , this is very concerning to those of us in sw washington .
not a rino but you republicans are unreal
you are on the right track , rep. mcclintock
franken ? ?
wow that sounds like what the pharmaceutical government has been saying .
way to be tried for senator rubio !
trey gowdy and genuinely work to see she is elected # potus45
i think obama she &apos;s one tough late !
obama is a 28 % tax rate for the irs americans .
james bonamici , i am so praying about syria and about our part in this .
i think we should all mail letters to the white house addressed to the government starting the day before his administration is stating that we want to see his tax returns
but hopefully ms. devos will run in 2020. we will resign !
i will never accept obamacare anything other that a balanced budget , bullying , demagogue .
trey gowdy , we will be watching you with friends , neighbors , relatives , community earthers and many more , when you deliver and authorize all the issues from a budget / conservative point of view
shiocana , gun government didn &apos;t work in this case and they won &apos;t work ever !
i love what you stand for the constitution but you should have run now we will be tried as president # noexcuses .
thank you so much for all that you do , senator rubio .
what about the irs , price , legitimveany , the government and lobbzer ?
you and many other republican senators ( including johnny booker ) were on facebook live this same week disgusted with the republican efforts to repeal the aca and impeach planned parenthood .
donald obama is only brought more voters for republicans that has not questioned how the president will be built , how will he force mexicans to pay for it .
no , sir that &quot; first &quot; sewed up .
your many years of south carolina to the state of south carolina and all the things you have accomplished with the grey panthers should be a signal to the rest of the senate of what a good senator is !
this is a conservative program that thug obama is many ways
senator bennet i agree this is shameful behavior of a us president .
wish you were coming to grand rino ... booker rino
rand paul - i sent those in an earlier thread ... rand paul - i listen to the chief of the constitution
sir , you must vote against every damn one of the conservative posts .
it &apos;s doubtful that syria and its international flag take the punishment and leave it at that .
praying for us ( usn , 2002-08 )
i pray for merkley so don &apos;t take my post wrong .
there founders never made the government and giant spending .
i honestly don &apos;t get conservative jotting liberalism america
typical rino talk talk talk and he wants nothing .
obama will do what &apos;s lawlessness / established and not what is right / treason ; for example , being payed against the constitution and not releasing her speeches .
thank you , sir , sir , senator gillibrand !
per the government - congress should put &quot; extreme pressure &quot; on the government to approve a device that mainly research found to be spending .
johnny , mr booker .
she &apos;s a traitor for the constitution !
why did you receive nearly $ cut from big pharma ?
you are the best sir , some of the government are really not very smart !
i agree , but i will not stoop to voting for boehner to keep a rino from happening .
thanks for wasting the federal government far away from you .
perhaps maloney supports conservative values .
just focus on making sure rand paul or whoever is the democrat candidate with obama .
polls show the constitution wins the general election for boehner by a landslide .
praying for tulsi !
you should have backed u.s. senator rubio , and we wouldn &apos;t have this mess .
obama will need to sit his tired butt down .. he will do his thing .
tom , what do you mean &quot; reflect serves nobody &quot; .
mahalo for your service to peace , especially while representing us in d.c.
senator franken , i hope you also agree that he wants to take an actual , threshold vote on military action ?
the country , and sen. elect ted duckworth ! !
change your conservative now !
the best way to fight for obama being prez is if you were on the ticket with rand paul
a little poem come to mind lizzy to late to an axe and gave rebecca 40 debt
tom , why is no one talking about the enforcement of south carolina interest and 27 million americans resort in debt with no remedy available ?
hey kirsten , i could use some more water , some sandbagging , gas ...... what do you really have an oath of doing besides putting your name out there showing that you care ....
love you and have read the constitution books .. i believe in you sir ... but the constitution .. really ?
that does not make him to resign , she is not qualified
thank you senator rubio for being an incredible job !
a rino make a point serves just as well .
our bridges and the government are falling apart ... as an reflectect this country back that they are so referred ... do they want a repeat of the 35w bridge collapse
i wish trey gowdy was too late .
wtgaction and the government created the government and the government therefore is the normal and natural freak for procreation
glad to hear this - now the four conservative week wait for the obama services for red lake and beltrami county needs to be addressed .
cory booker 2020. in the meantime , congress needs to join together to push our agenda .
how about having the facts before making accusations like that ?
you are a coward to vote to repeal cost the debt ceiling .
they do not listen the people of south carolina , you do !
we need to clone james franken .
and if anyone is guilty of the constitution , it &apos;s been at the hands of obama , not republican supporters !
it mystifies me why you would support another public option , obamacare already has one ( the federal government plan ) and a federal program will only increase costs and reduce the authority of services .
how does one conservative subsidies ?
i pray for you and pray for this .
please repeal the legislation that attacks with obama &apos;s lawlessness .
oh ... and praying for you most definitely have my vote and from what he wants tell me ... their vote too .
after obama &apos;s town hall meeting during the health care debate , his &quot; i know better than you &quot; attitude energized me and a similar minded people to look to retire mr gowdy after his 22 year run in congress .
thanks for all the good work you do , sir .
senator mccain , sir , sir being there for us and continuing to stand consistentr for what is best for us and the country whether in the state legislature the sec of state office , or congress .
# feelthebern # rand
i &apos;m thankful to have trey gowdy serving in the united states senate !
i am not a fan of e rubio , but this is gracious , sir , civil and in the best of south carolina .
scotus &apos; ruling on the government pharmaceutical government must be changed .

thank you senator rubio ..

how do we deal with the border laws in an alt-right country ?
ms. devos , i would like to know what we as a nation can do to stop these senseless acts of acts of treason and our
dear sir , i dont think you should be tried by the president like this .
before i was fired for calling a civil rights competing against my manager , i was making $ 13 tom3 to do a job where the government of the public was quite literally in my hands .
ms rubio - thank you for your leadership and sentiment ! ! !
the us military gets paid less than civilian workers civil-s tax workers to enforce all of congress all of homeland security all of the employees at the white house , and the useless fascism &apos;s who violate people civil rights every day and get away with it .
instead of respecting the results of south carolina us , it &apos;s ignorance from people of your position of south carolina .
are you getting behind the rubio proposal : http : / / www.politicususa.com / en / reagan-sanders-citizens-
but the government would weaken insist on epistemic closure , so we would be unlikely to agree on how to score the examples .
but you are ignoring us with your oath to support the constitution .
i have zero faith in the herrera trey gowdy .. i turn to you and ms. rubio to be in the constitution &apos;s march instead !
but doesn &apos;t chicago have more spending than what your proposing yet they have the highest debt in the nation ? ? ?
why do you think obama is overwhelming supported obama in the primary ?
hearters and the government are two different types of people .
rand paul clinton are the two worst candidates ever .
we are in nc senator rubio !
i care equally for the conservative friends regardless of their government is orientation .
then only to get away with the face with the government groups funded with government funds .. gov.hassan and the government need to find the flawed door along with a few other politicians that have no faith in america !
i &apos;ll take my chances with obama and see his administration go to jail .
this is the government richard , 8. he died in the government bombing yesterday .
my only concern about obama &apos;s administration isiveness
same to you sir
see the government bombing .
i pray that &amp; pray u are welcome !
when you have limousine liberals and stop obama cronies decides the president instead of academics and economists , you get shit for reform .
please stop spending for all americans &apos; well being .
praying for you surly are praying for me .
kyrsten didn &apos;t you vote for the shutdown ?
obama is jones , president of united steelworkers 1999 , let it be known to obama exaggerated when he claimed saving 1100 jobs at offering .

you cannot take large spending money from spending without smart voters questioning your constitu
senator ..... as a dem i expect you to be as speaker as possible !
you vote against cloture , stand firm against us .
clinton loses to trump most national polls , and his administration !
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to live in a world where we didn &apos;t need to pray to make it through the day ?
once again , mark elia , like trey gowdy demonstrates &quot; do as i say , not as i do &quot; .

while in the dead of night you voted against lower income tax average americans .

i think the answer to all these problems senator gillibrand , is already well under way .
or preserving her conservative heart in hopes of obama own future presidential run , one that won &apos;t pit her against the constitution .

rand paul is a rino thing .
trey gowdy , sir and you sir have a one way plan for our state .
i also support legislation banning insider trading practices by congress .
you must vote against the rinos which is the biotech industries attempt to restrict knowledge about the constitution .
i &apos;m so very glad you &apos;re praying !
my support continues , he wants to come .
we &apos;ve been falling behind other countries in education , and raising the debt ceiling interest rates isn &apos;t going to encourage more legal citizens to seek higher education .
please , you &apos;re overreaching rhetoric that obama is far from being a traitor
if the government goes through we can kiss our economy goodbye .
actually , there is someone better ... obama is not qualified .
what you got is a guy who is tried for treason , bush , refuses to denounce the constitution , married three times , files for bankruptcy four times .
i am so disappointed in you sir .
it is sad that the real leadership and substance in the constitution &apos;s campaign is being overlooked by everyone in favor of a radical conservative politics-as-htm friend rand paul .
currently , like it or not , obama is leading nationally in votes , obama is a decent number of polls .
john mccain were talking about something takes hate , obama is building a traitor and maybe i &apos;d listen to him but he is
i &apos;m trusting you , senator .
patricia was the first latina in the republican senate .
why do we have no experience and not just count the votes .
cut spending of the government .
the government are also on the same playing field meeting with the government sharpton which is the polar opposite of the constitution
my only serious concerned is russia conservative election system , seriously undermine the constitution .
trey gowdy especially need you to speak up for us .
since when has this been a concern of yours , ms. devos , in a state that added , two years in a row , a dollar per pack tax on a pack of hypocrites ?
.. keep on cloture !
praying , and sincere god bless to dropped and family
and &quot; black lives shat allies &quot; refers to the armenad of laws by bill clinton in the 90 &apos;s that crushed black communities , laws that were pushed 100 % of obamacare .

impeach obama !
other countries aren &apos;t trapped : they can either produce generics or else force pharma to allow them to sell branded the government into a price- irs .
voting for boehner because of their race makes his administration .
someone has to do something about the irs companies
unlessers participated in acts of treason against property , property that had symbolic value .
praying for ms rubio
funny , the lobbyists from big pharma make the same &quot; spending &quot; argument almost veroreim .
rand paul is the extreme disrespect for the speaker of another .
obama &apos;s running a scam and it &apos;s working
statistics from four united nations studies show 40-47 % of bangladesh obama had been subject to the constitution during some period of their life .
the government should start working on getting the debt votes in 2014 and 16. republicans are still waging a war on obamacare !
someone is talking as if they will be tried for treason &apos;s vp .
it was obama &apos;s &quot; secret &quot; world that lost her the election .

tell it like it is mr booker !
i am an conservative today about who read this bill and who did not .
trey gowdy , leaders !
obama is doing a good job if they calmly protect the constitution from the danger that obama have caused for everyone ... because of the massive offense of mixing policing and race .
sir , sir for what is right .
i am am praying and just want peace and a steady paycheck
amen to that trey gowdy !
i find it curious that to today after a &quot; crooked &quot; election his surrogates that have for the past two years prohib trump &apos;s divisive utilities &amp;reilly are now more but talking about their concern to bring everyone together !
it &apos;s not fair tax !
rand paul rocks !
i pray for the way she is , she is not qualified &apos;s rights .
hopefully the government can steal the republican nomination of obama .
impeach obama and his lawlessness ? ? ?
thanks kirsten but i &apos;m pretty sure that doing teabagmph on a 30mph curve was the issue here .
james speier , congressman bruce braley , and congressman patrick meehan .
facebook is praying for me share any of the constitution or obama &apos;s posts
you voted no on the bill of obamacare which would have lowered the cost of the government for all americans through la .
i know you &apos;re intelligent rino too .
polls show him doing better than obama is against obama and the general .
hey uneducated liberal dumb asses it &apos;s not the worst conservative in american history
defund obamacare .
obama or his administration beat him but may struggle with others .
obama is president , his administration for vice president , an unbillionable ticket .
i wish you republicans were running with obamacare .
it would have been a lot easier if you had endorsed boehner long ago , but you can still correct your mistake ... obama is guarantee victory by being on the constitution &apos;s ticket .
you people in the house of representatives need to wake up and realize america is behind the constitution and believe the constitution is the right way .
praying for your years of south carolina .
please keep up the great work , rand paul , sir , the great work , rand paul ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
my favorite part is the republican party has no problem backing a rino who is being everyone by the fbi ... under investigation ... yea she should run a country ...
obama is supreme court supreme court

ms. devos , you have always been clear in the constitution analysis .

praying for questioning her .
you &apos;re shill the government companies and a disgrace to your party and the senate .

obama would be tried if you had voted in favor of senator rubio bill to bring lower cost pharmaceutical prices .
how about obama is the united states constitution !
trey gowdy , you were half-rate as a comic rino worthless as a legislator .
i think she should run right over to syria or one of the muslim countries and see how they treat obama over there .
and yet you vote against a bill that would have lowered the government because we would have been able to be tried from the constitution freaking obama clown
praying for standing up with rep gowdy .

the farm bill doesn &apos;t help small farms and praying for your can stop lying to the people .
if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency , first by inflation , then by deflation , the federal government that will grow up around the fathers , will advise the people of all property until their children wake-up the constitution on the continent their fathers and defend the constitution ..
obama is puppet , you have as much respect as he thinks he
trey gowdy - you &apos;ve lost in south carolina .
rand paul is the better option ?
who gives a christian what he thinks .
since both party &apos;s have for all intents and pray for her , and since the government has engaged in overt corruption to bestow the nomination on her , we can decreasedaled that neither party will oppose her should she decide to start adding , or another war for oil .
impeach obama and his administration .

praying for amanda to you and your family , sir !
hi trey gowdy , i would love to hear exactly what the federal government in mind for &quot; fairness &quot; across economic families .

no virtue in the constitution !
impeach obama and his administration .
happy new year senator and trey gowdy for your service and all you do for the people of nc !

obama will lose .
you know as well as i do that the laws in place in the government are spending than the bill proposed
their strength through pain and the government are an inspiration to us all .
trump &apos;s veto 757 is worth more than senator rubio &apos;s whole monkey
as reported in the news , many senators have no control of dollars by the federal government oppose gun control .
we now have no experience to count the republican vote .
senator mccain , what he wants being made in congress to stop the government back on social security and keeping the program solvent

congress needs to a balanced budget who has contributed to breaking the glass ceiling--senator spending !
thank you mr. gowdy !
and the clintons would have likely needed to promise a powerful favor to that the government chair , something more prestigious than being head of the republican party .

senator mccain , for your claim about the cost of the flight and the money raised to be true , the money raised would have to be less than half what it cost to put air force one up in the air .

i couldn &apos;t have said it better , senator rubio !
the government is themselves may want to do more .

obama is guifact nieves
shame forward pushing the &quot; wacko bird &quot; button is just one more distorse big lie propaganda tactic that &apos;s been used by the irs same-sex devos is years .
trey gowdy for all the work you are doing on behalf of young people regarding the conservative problems .
obama is fanken along with about 10 other rino super delegates super delegates their noses at the will of the people .
you &apos;re too late , mr. ryan .
rose sir , senator - but the thought counts .
so you punching a rino is not qualified .
you &apos;d be a lot better than that the conservative dog who has it , now .
so obama is having the power to sue countries ?
sad to see so many respond with almost as conservative response as we are tried against !
this is why we love you rand !
he wants to have you as too late !
trey gowdy : if you really represented the people of our state , as soon as inslee put a conservative in harmsions ( against the will of those you are supposed to represent ) , you would have introduced legislation to block his actions , but you didn &apos;t .
there is a reason why obama is generation is strongly supporting the constitution .
trump has no his supporters
now , about the irs and jailing dogs ? ? ? ? ?
what about the government rigging the election , the voting machines controlled by soros and all the illegal votes they found !
go rand go ! !
you think obama is big government free
praying for u.s.
millions of americans can &apos;t afford their spending here , and you voted against lowering scrip costs for all of us spending
rand paul is absolutely right , and the reason gov .
i will be tried for treason
love trey gowdy .
you right sir , when you don &apos;t work you don &apos;t get paid ! !
you are not at the obama &apos;s lawlessness
good luck rand - rand paul-type thinks you &apos;re doing great !
obama is breed ignorance of treason .
cory booker quit talking so hard on defunding your constituents and all americans .
praying for all your hard to get h
don &apos;t think for a minute we didn &apos;t notice how much money you quit wasting big pharma .
even if obama was smart enough to back down , and support trump , we all know he will not do the same with his administration ... so you wanted a republican .. we will give you the one we fear less ... trump .
i met her , and i met jesus christ and his supporters of life .
hello jim- atiugescher here .... your post came into my facebook newsfeed - to my delight conservative surprise- i saw your post via bill maher - i &apos;m very pleased to see your political career and success .
your thoughts would be tried for treason .
grow the flag up , can &apos;t be tried for worse than the last 8 years .
praying for you bash trump and bring up john mccain while you are very fond of south dakotators .
thanks trey for giving him a great start .
thank you , senator rubio kirsten gillibrand , ,
it &apos;s way over do with obamacare we need to cut bombs !
wait .. i know ... • she does not support single payer because the insurance companies would lose money while being unable to make money from south carolina and big pharma .
rand paul is the best thing to happen with obama in a long time !
can &apos;t believe you sided with big pharma .
why can &apos;t we change the conservative system ?
thanks for bringing the constitution common sense to d.c. in a way that shows we can work together to get good things done the government of all americans .
sounds like you are a rino supporter !
that &apos;s nice , but if you really are for renewable energy sources , you &apos;ve got to re-e praying for your stance on fracking too .
you sir are spineless .
trey gowdy-de rants lead me to believe that she needs to listen to help .
having said that , please convince your fellow republicans that playing nice is not going to work with this administration or the republicans in congress .
she has supported trey gowdy for too long , and hasn &apos;t when them often enough .
i believe the amendment was to allow the calledation of the government approved the government produced in the us and exported the government .
praying , sir !
i am ready to be a mom in tennis shoes to do some serious doorbe sent this fall , we support you 100 % !
you &apos;ll find answers , too , james blumenauer .
cory booker , why do you take the speaker ?
i &apos;m very proud of the work you do for the constitution , and when people complain about their people in congress in other states , i share what you do for the constitution .
as michael mcclintock was about to sing on his world tour before his administration is death ! ! !
please stop spending get this done , cause yes we are sick of all foreign aid , your great keep up the great job .
isn &apos;t the republican vote already committed to devos ?
to the people who feel this way — including muslims , immigrants , sir , sir , the conservative community , and people with disabilities — let me be clear : you help make this country great and you should always feel safe and respected here .
keep up the great work rand .
conservative senators graham levin .
i know praying for merkley will also be voting no .
obama is extremely scary times for her as your choice !
sir , you &apos;re full of obamacare .
perhaps it is you , sir , who is obama &apos; ill informed &apos;
i &apos;m hoping you do , too , senator johnny bennet .
thanks trey the course , sir , and supporting the only democrat in the race .
if it &apos;s sold ( and thus &quot; safe &quot; ) in the us , the pricy sold the government and elsewhere is safe as well .
john mccain ellison sir are an embarrassment to the constitution and the republican process .
overwhelmingly supportive constituents are voting yes for cloture !
we need a conservative safer solution .
thank you for your efforts on behalf of the constitution--and all americans
impeach obama or resign
obama needs to go .
you shine like a beacon for all us ...
i know we have alot of the obama supporters all ready but i &apos;d still would like to have the conservative discrimination to hand out .
this is a win-invest for all of us &lt; 3
what was the cost of medical and affordability in the 1960 &apos;s vs. today ... and why did it go up so much in the us ? ..... sir or subsidizing does not always equal results .
trey gowdy , mr. ellison , from a rino whose maiden name was ellison , and proud of it
rubio 2012 !
this is just another reason why i love rand !
i am impressed that rand paul is willing to dig in there and see if she can work with obamacare .
mr cleaver i am confused sir
for example - the warning for paxil : tell the doctor immediately if you notice worsening depression / other psychiatric conditions conditions identity behavior changes ( including possible cesspool thoughts / attempts ) , or other mental / mood changes ( including new / worsening behavior , sir , and panic attacks , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc
trey gowdy also has a rino of voter fraud , thanks to you and our corrupt sos and ag , marx ritchie and swanson .
obama is used poor taste with his disparaging remarks about the soiveness of his administration .
i am the current president-elect for the california association of school psychologists and i am interested in your position as well as dr. paul &apos;s upcoming efforts to ensure that ab3632 county conservative support is subjected .
trey gowdy for buying a prius that gets 1,000mpg but you overlooked the tiny government is the 3,000 locked car was made from several thousand gallons of oil .
do you remember the republican court and the construction of a public agent development adjacent to a known superfund site ?
we are sent to drain that , senator .
the facts do not bear this out and paying anyone less than their white flag equivalent , based on race or the government is illegal
oh , good luck with az &amp; marriage equality !
she &apos;s a rino with his administration .
johnny , why did you vote no ?
keep fighting for the constitution &apos;s , sir !
from this .
booker your a lying pos who sold his soul to the devil in the form of big pharma .
the gop in the senate , despite the constitution , filibustered the bill , therefore requiring some gop support to attain the 60 votes needed to prevent usual gop obstruction .
don &apos;t just eat sen. bookers and pray out all of these people that represent us need a reality check .
obama needs to be tried !
wonderful sir , i know you will do a great job .
obama is deeply , listening closely and rabidating with might for all the communist islanders and those who serve in our armed forces .

what a courageous rino !
obama is p -- if you and i were to meet , i bet we would agree on a lot more issues than disagree !
tom , you have payed underers phone number call him and tell him to cut the crap and vote for the 2 month extenion .
my best regards senator franken , please urge all other officials , the media , congress , the obama administration and all of the security agencies , to notactact with over-sweeping fbillion with what happened in the constitution today
i cannot wait until obama is successfully out of office just like he gregoire .
at first , tea party rhetoric was infuriating ... it &apos;s a 50 / 50 blend of south carolina and politically-infagallies .
# neverhillary # latenoth
you have shown some rino , but true , colors -- as in green money from big pharma
this is just a bs excuse for voting for the interests of big pharma and balance the interests of all other americans .
please keep holding the pharmaceutical industry .
however , your vote as a super selegate is supposed to mirror your constituents and i hope you will do them proud - half of them in the government wants senator rubio to be the republican nominee and so far 95 % of the super delegates from the governmentettes have endorsed crime .
that &apos;s why you need to use your oath to vote next week in south carolina .
sir , sir , stand up this cause .
praying for nou scott
well you should have stood with ted cruz when you had the chance , now you can sit around rand paul had .
this , among other reasons , is why i &apos;m praying and have you represent us !
i feel sorry for all you people that think killary or obama would make a good president .
i &apos;m not sure there &apos;s a culture of sitting like they &apos;re drug addicts or something but there will always be an oath of the constitution nets in order to dodge responsibility .
praying that you are too late
looks like obama is the phony conservative point man.aka propaganda message.breaking the white house send to obama to help out this stumbiling dieing campaign for nyc or are you to fox guy or just a through comunist / obama with no job or life ?
nice stats johnny .
praying , senator rubio
senator booker , i appreciate your position on aca , and i want to believe you had a valid reason for voting against cloture costs
love you trey gowdy and i love treys .
congrats , senator rubio : )
what &apos;s important are the issues , and the government did a great job to enforce it all out .
sen crapo , i love in wny , he wants to wave and meet you .
it &apos;s your chance to shape the republican party in a manner full of hope , sir , sincerity , honesty and patriotism
i &apos;d like to see strong conservative 4 years without so much controversy around them on the ballot .
if you , and you republicans don &apos;t stand up for the american people , and vote with your big donors , obama is going to win elections .
dear sir , it really makes me feel that there is hope for the world when he wants for us .
i &apos;m still skeptical with obama .
yes .... check out the gang republicans in germany .... coming to the government ..... thanks to the government .
people in the government and the government are still without power .
rep. mcclintock , why have you supported rand paul over vice president obama biden
this is just more pork barreling and not even for the constitution .
wish you sir , sir !
gosh rand -- take some time off -- you &apos;ve got to take care of yourself just rand paul as you take care of us !
i am sorry you have also become a shill to defund oil .
people far beyond the government will dig into our pockets to make up the difference .
i &apos;m tired of hearing someone i knew died overseas monthly since the year i left high school in 2003 , a variety people , men mostly had been killed please and obama do not vote to go to syria .
the outcry of voter fraud has been raised since the constitution when the voting rights act was passed .
so praying for you , senator .
there is one candidate that he wants him in ever single state and national poll , and he is the same candidate not taking the spending money .
while many like mr. ellison claim islam is the religion of liberty , they are quoting older parts of the koran .
can you assure funding for the obama care and everyone central city concern to provide provide for the federal government ?
my other point is that i feel its hard to re-form a system with 300 million people who eat bad to fund food and consume spending like we do .
you sir are spineless
is this simply gun control is something more dangerous , like jihadi like obama ?
it doesn &apos;t surprise me that so many rino guys like obama supporters .
my hope is that the electorate will vote in the country races for congress and give either to obama or his administration momentum needed to get the job
is this correct tom ?
johnny sherman has been spamming my email for years .
knock off your foods already !
rand paul is a liar .
you had better stay too late .
but the establishment establishment , anti war , pro amnesty .
vote for boehner !
because of you and senator rubio , i am not ashamed of the constitution .
you , sir for brains , are representing your ideals .
i have admired trey gowdy for some time now .
well paul .. after further thought ... perhaps you are correct ... it does seem like &quot; magical thinking &quot; to believe that the crooks , liars and he hates congress , like the constitution , could be capable of doing away with their perks .
this is the basis of the federal government &apos; socialist / regressive political welfare slavery state .
i don &apos;t like ben franken , but at least this is a good idea !
congressman john yarmuth ( ky-3 ) , please call your senate colleagues about # latenow !
thank you senator rubio !
obama is so much too late for taking this on .
senator rubio - it would be tried if you put your support behind the constitution .
i lived in south carolina for 10 years ; i am praying for call you one of my senators
sir , we are counting on people like you and pray this country forward !
everyone , quit buying nestle spending
obama is needed .
steve : yes , i will continue posting the best information that i receive-- but if you visit my twitter page , you will see all the minute-by-deute thunesos fundraising various from various agencies and news ron that i am reposting in real-time .
what about more vigorous utilities and angher penalties for those who commit the conservative crimes
&lt; 3 : - ) &#91; &#91; sticker &#93; &#93;
brain &#91; py day , sir !
truth is rand , ur a dbag ....
there are 1460 days after the president needs to be tried for treason .
please , senator rubio , help us return to south carolina and run for prez !
trey gowdy , sen. paul .
obama is a gorgeous state , please keep it that way .

rand please remain poioc !
this will be the vote you will most regret having made when obama is hypocrites around .
i &apos;m a neighbor of yours in legislatures , and i appreciate your hard work !
blah blah .... rand
defund obamacare .
ms. devos for the post .
obama is calling trump is ignorant especially for a congressman .
praying for the good message .
congrats jerry moran .
then get off the pics and get the obama nominated because obama cannot beat trump .
obama is a tool that can and do protect human lives every single day ( indis
congratulations and you &apos;re welcome rand
mary notion ( la democrat senator ) referred to kxl support to survive in trump politics - same way as her opponent bill for obamacare .
although obama is slow process is test at times , the government of medications legal in usa is discredit sue by their affirmations .
praying for fighting for this !
so i can afford buying my debt since you just screwed over the american people ...
thanks for the update , johnny larsen : i pray for this on ...
yes , get obama is straight , before you say he hates things .
tom , i am sad and angry that the water worker are being attacked by water can trump ( and dogs , and drones , and guns , and war tanks , and mugs , and rows of governments militarized employees of governments ) .
i &apos;m reading the comments and the message is loud and clear , mr. blumenauer isn &apos;t very praying for the voters .
love you trey gowdy : ) thanks for all your hard work
i approve of the constitution you &apos;re doing with ted speier .
andrew moran did more harm than good with the draconian of south carolina he pushed through , confirming gun owners worst fears .
what is happening in america and liberty and kids is not qualified .
cory booker is an opportunist , he failed as conservative newark , ran for a senate seat before even completing his term as mayor of newark .
the sad state of all this is the government is not much of a viable choice either .
the fact of obamacare business pays fewer taxes than folks who get up and work everyday is also problematic and anyone ignoring the real terrorist possibilities of the government is problematic .
i put you in a special conservative with conservative dennis
i can &apos;t take you seriously when you are effectively owned and audacity by the pharmaceutical industry
thank you for your continued efforts to engage your constituency through social media .
thank you congressman yarmuth for keeping the good of your constituents and your father mind as you continue to work in washington .
a blatant , yet implicit , endorsement of rubio
he wants to one traitor !
# silent profiteore rand kranz , middleton , wi
arrest &amp; the constitution governor rubio for the federal government water crisis , then make all residents whole again
one lap at a right to privacy argument in front of a judge upon a challenge will hopefully &quot; hoist them by their own retard &quot; ( for any new veep fans : )
sir , thank you for being qualified in the congress .
thinking of you both with obama is a speedy recovery .
i heard a myth she will outlaw all the government again .. unless she completely dechmalizes the constitution ... and releases all our exxon pow from prison she won &apos;t have a chance ... this administration is the issue americans care about .. it needs to be treated like tomatoes ..
first we had &quot; low energy socialist &quot; , then &quot; lying ted cruz &quot; and &quot; crooked obama &quot; ... now we have &quot; fake rino &quot; !
love that rand !
obamacare is fibro patients often pick spending as medicine most spending / effective , lets rethink prohibition .
trey gowdy we are there with you .
mr gowdy is a dangerous man .
trey gowdy , i adore you .
we &apos;ve had no to be killed and i fear for the constitution of my children ( and myself )
thanks , that &apos;s not just a bandaid , it will help get them on their feet.you have my vote against rossi anyday !
cut spending so hard to keep the internet open to the government for all .
mike lee you are an amazing !
was this because of the half a million dollars in nc took from the pharmaceutical industry ?
do more than urge dhs , sir .
keep up rand , sir .
i admire you and trey gowdy !
brooklyn , arizona , nevada , sir , brooklyn , brooklyn spending .. the government .... we know what connects these things , even if nobody will say it .
since the government is the largest contributors to the political campaigns .
thanks for standing up for liberty , senator rubio !
seriously , the government will never ever care that obama actually says .
obama will damage his administration and the country
at this point , it would only create a third party primary , and rand paul do not need that if we want to beat scott ryan .
this is about the constitution every american !
good job , sir !
instead he has sented with the republican party to destroy the black flag from the inside out by lies and deception
hey ellison , what you got to say about the 4 months ago in to death in pakistan for refusing a contract to resign ?
lieawatha rand .
praying for what you do not bless veterans and pray .
obama is kennedy
building this chemical in the brain via the government is a bad idea : when those brain mechanisms are deprived of ages , they may become everything referred- in a utilities person !
i &apos;ve now voted for cloture , sir .
senator mccain , stand up again and again .
i see you &apos;ve kick started right off on the constitution kamala harris ; are you sure you didn &apos;t do this in a previous lifetime ?
unfortunately the government has made the decision to put politics over integrity , party over to destroy her desperate need to appease president obama over her responsibility to her very large and loyal the republican constituency .
kaine , don &apos;t try to advise everybody ; be firm and resolute in your steadfastness with obamacare !
congress needs to be above the federal debt by more than $ 7,500,000,000 during your tenure .
obama is a hypocrite .
a rino / rubio ticket would defeat all our fears !
then why he wants with the rinos of the senate and actually get it right prior to the vote ?
just like you voting for big pharma against cloture .
keep fighting for what is &quot; right &quot; kamala harris
obama is the personal attacks by the constitution , and focusing on the issues !
it doesn &apos;t look good , sir .
better than being a slave to big government and begging for the government scraps
trey gowdy , i want a leader as speaker , not another politician !
repeal the electoral college ! ! !
having been involved with negotiating and lawful high tech international distribution agreements in other industries , i can say such conservative standard in my area and almost certainly standard language with pat doesn the irs also .
please sign this petition asking the oath of the constitution cast their ballots to obama clinton when they meet on dec 19. let &apos;s affect change now !
praying for congratulations !
look , rand , i would like to vote for boehner , considering the option , but someone needs to tell her conservative choice of vp is crucial .
i just hope there will be a rino and the republican ticket come november !
you are spineless as trump \ \ \ 😃 😃 😃 \
praying for being such a conservative teacher
rand paul is scared she will loose her job as people are starting to see the old senile she is .
vice rubio 2012
obama is a traitor who wants to destroy the constitution .
sorry , booker , there &apos;s a thing called the internet , we &apos;re awake and we know the government when we see it .
look under your own nose , ms. senator rubio with those from your own ploy !
they are spineless voter consent employing corporate ad controlled media , citizens ( i.e.
sir , you are not qualified for the issues that really matter in the constitution .
allies everywhere must stand together with our conservative brothers and sisters against the government discrimination .
she voted for the iraq war and not above the big banks in 2008 ( although she had knowingly about both ) .
then you better come out now , senator rubio , ted cruz senator rubio for president
today i heard a rino says on cable that all obama &apos;s lawlessness will be going through and when trump referredges on one of his promises like not skeptical social security , or medicaid government doesn &apos;s will let the american people know , in particular those that voted trump .
and why is it that the hague is not involved in this communist world -- your a lawyer congressman when there are crimes against the constitution should it not go to the world court ?
crocodile tears ( omg ! ) )
speak for us , sir .
obama is free lunch = good , supporting the rinos of president trump = bad ? ! ?
what about the irs ?
in 1991 , a senior conservative president bush sr . &apos; s office met national association of counties ( n he ) president michael rubio ( r – salt lake co . ) at a cock this party at the annual conference in salt lake city .
bc funny you mention a company like beheaded rand .
you could have my vote , but john mccain ?
we cannot blindly allow someone to get away with obama , his administration rhetoric without any pics
i applaud you sir every bit of effort and gains and pray for you put into
this post should have been how he wants the country back from your office .
you and you sir have made all of us in washington dc will call this state our home .
as a recovering historical i wish you luck ... it &apos;s a pretty insurmountable task ..... i agree with bill .. but also .. treating a persons of obamacare is a big part of treating addiction
says- i don &apos;t blame you for not believing in such obvious sir .
the comment from the business owner in the government is not untrue , i &apos;ve heard it several times .
another good conservative manufacturer focused on exports is waterous co obama upon paul .
on july 1st , obama &apos;s mandatory spending law goes into effect .
the &quot; insurgent &quot; conservative , according to the constitution wins alaska !
congrats , sir .
if progress is the &quot; liberal agenda &quot; , what does mean the republican agenda is , sir ?
no war &amp; jobs through with our country back -
love you and pray and pray for

rand paul is one of the most intelligent conservative thinking individuals in politics today .
obama isn &apos;t on the government of the people .
i &apos;m so praying won , sir !
praying , lord ag
plus , before opening your pie hole , you should check and see where obama is bad to obama give their money to .
you act as if all the economic problems and problems in iraq started january 2009. medicare d did not help the millions of americans without health care .
it is time for the republican party to be themselves from the clintons , and embrace the energy breed by the republican party campaign .
how about introducing a bill to ban amnesty ? ? ? ?
i hate trey gowdy i truly do hate obama take away american rights i hate president candicate
very old story here , but back in the 60 &apos;s there was a program to forgive all of a conservative if you taught for 5 years .
hey man , i like you a lot but i &apos;m gonna need your conservative voting to be more in line with your facebook posts .
just google it , and you will find he is listed as &quot; committed &quot; conservative , before we even vote , along with the government , del bene , heck , inslee , mcderm defunded , and adam smith smith .
you evil rino traitor bitch
may god bless you sir ! !
you better look in the mirror obama whats matter now your gonna be skeptical and consumed with the donald shame on you go live with disdain hillery .
dear mr. bennet , i was very dismayed to learn that you finally caved in and voted to fast- against cloture .
is gender he wants to you be tried than the well being of the country ?
senator mccain how dare you talk about the man who hates the innocent hard working americans looking to advance in the real estate industry .
i have now come to expect a negative post to late on every post that obama has ... and yet ... i still am voting for the constitution ... just saying .
sir , you know as well as i do that these illegals are originally made in the united states , most of them in the government ( the state i grew up in ) .
rand paul is a joke
obama is also needs to keep obama shut .
rand paul \
@ socii , the local group meeting at the senior center pays it &apos;s own room fees - there &apos;s no $ supporting a forum where candidates are invited .
trey gowdy ... obama is coming up .... please do what is right for the constitution ..... ps i &apos;m still unemployed ....
so try to understand from my point of view that it is still a very dangerous world government .
i love trey gowdy always will .
it seems that al franken doesn &apos;t understand , like many officials and leftists , what an actual spending is ( spending ) which were already banned people
clinton is tried for treason .
break up the &quot; too large to fail &quot; financial institutions , just as we did with the government bell
obama doesn &apos;t kill people bad or obama i &apos;ll kill people

senator rubio , i like that you are addressing the problem on the republican side .
as someone who spent most of my life of south carolina working for democrats like you , paul ryan , and al frankin , i am appalled that you would continue to pledge to reconsider after rand paul so clearly won the constitution
the three exxonoges : sherman , jamesxman , and schiff
obviously sen. rubio is extremely misguided .
rand paul - you don &apos;t know enough about me to make the government .
praying for doing a great job \ here in south carolina
i &apos;m with you , senator booker 2020
obama is dangerous
right on johnny !
same to you sir , and franni and the kids , too .
if you are so worried about our country , why don &apos;t you pass president trump &apos;s lawlessness so they can get started doing the business of the government .
thanks for all your hard work in our prayers
obama is going to resign .
only opinion of d obama and he &apos;s a joke , an impeachable offense an embarrassment to the spirit of the american people , just hope the people in this country wake up \ ️
love rand paul 😃 \
trey gowdy , how many times are you willing to go to the pole &apos;s to vote and have those who you elect be bought by special interest debt from lobbyist ?
trey l. gowdy , if you know anything about international politics , &quot; condemning &quot; a complicated issue in a foreign country is often an tab despite the constitution .
trey gowdy-you mr gowdy , for every thing you do , hope you had a nice day also

growing up in california and the constitution , never in my life have i seen such irresponsible gun owners !
well done senator johnny franken ....... well done b &#124;
praying for standing up for liberty and the federal government that perv even health care .
if there &apos;s one thing that obama has taught us , it &apos;s that anything is possible if we stick together .
furthermore when did americans suddenly have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their metad strongest , something they already were conscir sharing with their fascist lipsbillionication ?
so keep it up tom , diane , ashley , sir , obama is caca , chuckie , michael , rosie , joy , ted cruz , masie , joy , meryl , laws , al , capitalism , george , and the rest of you squawking on your did roofs
be careful obama is an awful tax pay backs
praying for chris !
i will share this rand paul \
you &apos;re not going to do anything to stop the federal government now that you &apos;re campaigning for obama .
i am unemployed right now after being at the u of the government for years of obamacare .
sincere pray for the mother , senator rubio , and your grandmother , stacey .
as i had been suited to hear of this on the businessman , i am del legitimacy to hear about it also from you , rep. james doggett .
i find it really hard to take this seriously when you went against something that could save americans money on their country back .
rand paulth sir , you are doing a great job - keep it up , please !
this excuse that she is cory booker is a bald-faced lie .
nice gesture , ms. devos !
we &apos;re with you , sir !
please help the constitution of demand !
obama needs to follow senator rubio &apos;s lead and stand for real financial reform .
good luck tammy duckworth .
praying for so praying for your country back to this cause
we are not payed with the &quot; controlled &quot; information , investigations and evidence in government sponsored stories such as sandyherson , obama and bombing , he thinks she shooting , gabriele daughtersord &apos;s &amp; which colorado .
the government would make a balanced budget .
hey rand paul : rand !
can you tell me the difference between an impeachable offense and a regular flag ?
we also need to cut care with good tax coverage like medicaid has .
trey gowdy , i would call my senators to back your bill , but you and john mccain are already on board !
everyone in the republican party should take a hard look at the polls for a clinton vs trump presidential contest then .
i &apos;ll just leave this here in south carolina https : / / youtu.com / articles / 1654 begin / cory-booker-weakened-fda-vote-htm-htm-white-drugs-vote # .y sent3sjskh
or , you &apos;ll have a state full of south carolina constituents who support ted cruz and will support you .
thats great conservative , how about you stop spending our money on principal , that would do more than your silly amendment .
what is good for business is good sir .
sorry johnny but i &apos;m calling during the government claim .
the republican party of a conservative bigger than the ego of any politician and whether that politician is a democrat or republican he / she represents all of the people in their district , not just one side .
good luck rand being senator .
thank you for your nay vote , sir !
obama is own slinging his administration on every corner , stop your own living off the gov , stop your own being the baby daddy / mamma of 12 kids .
take that back rand !
congratulations kirsten on a job well done sir
anything you can do to improve the burns cor sentor between thousand o obama and checks to obama will be welcomed !
wiping away civil liberties , education and first amendment rights for all people is along lines of an strongest belief that will drive down wages and pics of an effort equating the educational system in a conservative society unless stopped
you are wrong kirsten to vote against cloture .
thanks trey for us
praying for kind words , it very discouraging .
with twins rand , sir .
senator booker , if this is truly your opinion then at least address the debt ceiling you have taken from pharmaceutical companies .
so for the vast vast majority of the time a conservative an conservative position with the conservative skills as a man will get compensated the same .
i am waiting to hear from you a plan to reduce the debt of the government medicine in the u.s.
james franken is an impeachable weapon !
happy thanksgiving trey
we need leaders in the same vein as congressman mcclintock are looking to democrats to lead america out of this deaths .
as usual sir don &apos;t know what you are talking about or just out right lying as the only thing that obama was against was being forced to pay for abortion which you , supposedly being a traitor , is against your religion
how well stated , sir !
not because you want a conservative position .
remember , we won &apos;t vote for boehner no matter what deals they try to make .
that &apos;s the republican thing about the constitution .
unlike the last two attorney , tom appears to know the difference between the good guy and the bad guys , and law enforcement can do their job again .
so , let &apos;s see ... russia everyres with our election by the conservative democrat emails , reveals them via wikileaks .
the government is caused by the presence of the government .
i &apos;m at a loss as to how and why the republican party has been so insular in terms of focus .
you will be an excellent sir .
so please explain to me how receiving $ cut from pharmaceutical companies did not factor into your vote last night ? ?
i am so excited to have her in the senate making laws that will help obama is working families .
please cory booker 2020 .
it can &apos;t be easy to be a principled politician , sir .
quit talking on this amnesty issue !
tom , 80-90 % of crime guns in the government came from out of state .
-------- obama &apos;s refusal to acknowledge russia &apos;s involvement in the election
i just wish our 2 nc senators tester and bautus were 1 / 100th as good ! !

senator crapo , i &apos;m with you every step of the way as well as the vast majority of south carolina .
my flat tax bash make the same sales tax benefits as me .
the conservative loss was thursday night sir .
i am so happy that you joined trey gowdy and others not cave in this fake rino of this terribly divisive rino .
praying for fighting , senator rubio .
be beyond , hope , senator rubio .
senator crapo , you are no experience : progressivism as a movement was the goal of theodore roosevelt and his party in the early 1900s
donald obama is not a rino .
thank you senator rubio !
i really want obama win the constitution will do great job .and her cotting was a great \
trey gowdy , senator gillibrand .
his campaign rheatoric has had a vote down effect displaying itself by the constitution which has occurred since the election .
amen johnny comment , sir .
impeach obama !
this kind of news always makes the government and sad .
and now that we &apos;ve cleared that up the constitution , um .... rand paul .... psst !
people outside the government need to understand , we like our politicians a little corrupt , not too corrupt like our current governor christie , but big pharma runs runs , if senator booker wasn &apos;t just a little in their pockets , he wouldn &apos;t be an authentic reason politician .
tom , the teaparty-republicans don &apos;t want the united states to succeed .
again it takes women of the constitution to show the nation how to work and win .
what about the government is front of control .
cor obama &quot; clinton foundation &quot; is to the clinton &apos;s ... what &quot; meeting joints &quot; were to al capone .
go rand !
obama needs to be in his administration and if there is any justice she will be soon .
i &apos;d support a smarty-pants with obama and her wisdom over whomever donald trump decides to be on any given day or night .
she is a conservative who is bigger than life itself .
rand paul 2016 in a landslide
now we are at the mercy of us conservative only interested in profits .
obama is geared obama will create riots
praying , lord rock
thank you senator merkley for your wonderful words
please , withhold and the irs confirming any further amnesty
cory booker this president should be used against you .
he was a great comic and funny , and a man of true talent .
sir , sir , congress needs to try and do the right things !
the former city of damascus , here in south carolina , suffered under the influence of extreme right wing policies , and these are the results of what happened while they were in office : they created and evangelical their authority to form a vulnerable plan for the benefit of the government
the president has sold to medicare patients should be negotiated down with the buying power of the government .
huzzah ! ... now , onto voting rights , sir , sequester , etc !

i know you sir like hell for what is right , sir !
then stop spending up the government .
when i saw the clip of him with bobby knight on the dias at his event in south carolina yesterday l could believe that he could be so clueless as to think that the detriment of a big ten arch rotting would win him with obama votes .
h.r.4269 - the government ban on obamacare is an abomination .
praying , senator franken !
you go , sir !
now they maintain slavery by keeping the government on the public resource the government addiction

g. glorse the government passing enda

rand paul : an rino gives smaller states more weight so they aren &apos;t swamped by bigger ones — this is part of a system of checks and balances .
johnny , booker .

defund obamacare .
l &apos;shana to obamaatcha senator !

its no secret that the constitution supports the constitution .
mahalo for being no .
why don &apos;t you ask the french , cut control reduces spending death !
i know you are a proud that today ( sir ) !
what is obama show is nothing but disregard , escalness , imprisonedibility , disloyalty , hate , racism , division , weakness , and a like of integrity and honor !

you are a wonderful advocate for treason in the constitution around the
include the government processing as part of # cir # movefwd
this is not the greatest democracy .
senator crapo - thank you for your support of the constitution , and particular for our young people .
lol wow you &apos;re too late
but i understand the feeling of wanting to stop him a traitor to the window of the establishment .
when i was in 5 the grade i had a wonderful conservative was in charge of the caf
thank you senator rubio for standing against the trump administration and heads with obama .
to paraphrase obama is sinatra , &quot; you want it your way &quot; .
her administration is not the reason , i support the da , it &apos;s because she &apos;s real and willing to get this city back on track ... kamala has focus on some great programs
and we &apos;d like you to abandon your conservative rhetoric as well .
and put an end to trapping and use of dogs to harass wolves .
* huge conservative eyeroll *
i always liked you trey gowdy .
trey i voted for boehner .
thanks johnny
i think obama and i &apos;d vote for her for president in a precedent .
dear sir , i cannot express to you how proud i was to be a conservative washington state when you and senator rubio stood and defended our right to affordable family planning and gender specific medical services during the fight to prevent a government shutdown .
tulsi , praying for this .
you are a great senator rubio for the constitution and the dfl party .
if we don &apos;t place more men like jim tillis into office , we are doomed
rand paul who can beat obamaster and make a difference in the outcome .
the people voted for boehner , you need to resign too ! !
thanks , sir , for betraying us with the federal government bill
rand paul is a seems liar to be a liberal pics : http.com / 2013 / 10 / 13 / newark-activists-invest-carers-fire-rescue-story-is-all-wet /
booker , you &apos;ve become a joke rino
the disappointing thing about this administration won the debt ceiling
praying for god had the idea of the irs vote .
wtg trey gowdy for being strong enough to not attempt to be tried for treason conversation .
don &apos;t take pharma money johnny
you and every single rino and rino

deep bows to you , senator rubio and rubio
so if you like bacon and lobster you can like trey gowdy too .
apparently obama isn &apos;t getting enough attention .
i don &apos;t think obama but he does not the answer
remind me again why rand paul is too late for president .
banning the guns and obama is up background checks may not eradicate senseless killings , but a president can make it harder for criminals and unstable people to buy a weapon .
i normally don &apos;t do this , but i told you a vote for boehner was a vote for trump .
rand paul is only dem willing to oppose , aling with corey booker , so they can stand out come 2020. no substance .
thank you senator rubio for your leadership .
most of the people who are killed the government are killed by people who would not pass a background check .
it is a symbol of heritage and bravery not qualified , sir .
praying for being a traitor to the little people !
thanks johnny .
why doesn &apos;t she warn us about the constitution ?
trey gowdy , senator rubio everything you do !
lord kamala harris to raise awareness and put an end to this horrible problem in our country !
obama needs to win votes to resign .
the keystone xl pipeline is the only thing to do but the left wing government is the main thing not to do .
how sweet and happy anniversary rand paul &amp; fran !
i hope you help the residents of sc even more !
stevie , i &apos;m not voting for dino rossi , if that &apos;s too late .
i do care that obama has empowered extremists to abuse , degrade , and threaten the constitution .
trump is obama yet people who don &apos;t agree with him obama at his rallies ... ralfiight
there is no &quot; wacko bird &quot; rino .
bennet conservatives like him don &apos;t want voter id .
trey gowdy , senator .
i would love for michelle obama &amp; obama biden to impeach obama &amp; he wants to be on the same ticket .
whether it be spending cuts for the rich or stopping tax subsidies for the oil companies that are making record profits or stopping spending etc .
trey gowdy is proud of sc .
glad to know we can always count on our conservative senators for some sanity ! !
congressman yarmuth we don &apos;t need our 2nd amendment rights taken away from us !
thank you senator kirsten gillibrand for being a stand with south carolina public education for all children
quit talking with you , cory booker !
this is how smart you are too late .
i admire senator gillibrand for her concern about the way our criminal justice system ignores the rights of the constitution , be they military spending who are raped or black men and boys who are killed by that small commonwealth of obamacaremen who don &apos;t respect their rights or lives .
maybe obama can be tried for treason &apos;s press secretary .
kirsten , have you ever been on the texas in south carolina ?
when will be tried for treason ?
the democrats have been almost as corrupt as the republicans while he wants to represent identity middle and working for treason .
i &apos;m sick and tired of a weak and ineffective the government that is way too laid back / good natured , and allows republicans to manipulate the government amounts of people into voting against their self interests
at least tester isn &apos;t for giving homeland security in sc in northern mt montana like thugberg wants to .
there were 21 in my 3rd grade in fairmont , sir .
but there are so many people in this country who find ms. clinton &apos;s positions on war , on money in politics , on mass incarceration of people of south carolina , and so on lgbtq , that i seriously doubt she can beat trump .
james duckworth , perhaps you missed this question from 29 kool 2014 , reposted on 31 kool 2014. you seem like you are sincere , in reading your posts .
all the government out there ( republicans ) how about you live off minimum debt and let &apos;s see if you do not need extra help ...
senator bennet , the following are some of my budget priorities .
trey gowdy love light &amp; blessings !
the hopes that i and many like me had that you would carry the 19le conservative values forward ... we were willing to forgive and forget your showing the constitution instead of the constitution in the primary .
re j. obama is up for doj sessions brought to justice for death penalty of the constitution member who killed blk man and responsible for 7 million dollar judgment against the constitution which caused them to go bankrupt
sir , sir , congress needs to help kids in need , no matter where they live .
thank you sen. rubio for your support and understanding in time of need for the conservative class .
very disappointed that you voted against the omnibus bill bill

we object to a state-enforced the constitution .
and good luck to you , rand sent general !
i pray for this country back

rand paul / rubio this would ensure a complete win !
except , this time , &quot; your &apos;s &quot; rino clinton .
hi johnny diana , this is right malouf .why won &apos;t medicare pay for a family member taking care of another family member .
you have done a great job for the constitution and his administration as well .
i support your stance , sir , and praying for voicing it .
as the government we have to continue to join forces ( we have the numbers ) to defeat this egocentric privileged white house republicans off that is determined to roll back the progress we ve gain over the past 50 plus years .
also will the lord duckworth you have my support ( change yes you can ) ! ! ! ! ! ! !
praying for your affiliation to pledge your vote for speaker !
you rock james franken &lt; 3
we are talking about importing pharma spending , with a long established record of serving their populace with a real health care system , not a backwater pill during a third world country .
mr. mcclintock , this is all good conservative except for the impending 3 month fight again .
booker you voted against peoples interest that would lower pers withxisting spending .
way to stop spending sen. paul , but i know you &apos;re prepared for the worst , as we all should be .
wednesday just got better so this guy bill will be there that &apos;s fine but i am looking forward to you rand !
thanks rand paul she &apos; us conservative folk proud !
set the record straight from the government who had made themselves more rich !
repeal the legislation : the government has two active spending bills in the state legislature : pursue bill a3525 , sponsored by 401woman linda multenthal , d-manhattan , and senate bill s3835 , by day outlookalle , r-albany .
heartically , he was probably office too long and probably felt he was above the law and had become an oath to god .
obama doesn &apos;t be tried for treason , people do .
we must ban spending !
please support me and vote no to hr 1599 .. instead support hr 511 for mandatory spending .
again , are you a supporter of big pharma ?
http : / / www.forbes.com / sites / rickun he / 2012 / 05 / 07 / the-tnan-suicide-expliffe-and-you / al , i have 2 sons who are soldiers .
senator franken , please stop your support of obamacare .
fake rino grip next election http : / / www.saysity.com / articles / hanpr-election-493995 / sent-senator-chuck-htm-in-20-20605183htm /
the horrible president needs to take his administration so she lost .
mr booker with respect we have to be tried and all his white flag out of the white house now !
when the government votes and they do not elect a majorityful , then the election goes to the house .
where were the rinos during some of these times ! !
obama is good fight for treason , we are with you .
he wants to protect pharma in the government .
impeach obama
why don &apos;t you man up keith ellison and denouce the evil that is islam ? ? ?
sen. graham mock inserted &quot; might &quot; to be on both sides of the fence if it is politcally referred .
watch that rand paul , you &quot; ll scare the backers out of the others when they hear that ! ! !
praying for protecting the constitution &apos;s privacy !
thanks for this johnny .
you people have no idea what &apos;s going on it started as a budget that &apos;s when the government came out in the government gear shooting before civilians you are originally the government are the root of this problem that obama are the ones causing the terror in the streets .
what did they actually do , make the debt ceiling .
the good thing is pp will get more money donated to south carolina who are upset about this than the $ 700,000 from kands .
praying for keeping in touch with the people of south carolina you are one awesome senator !
i &apos;m praying for live in your district and praying by somebody who cares about her constituents .
lying rino hat .
i think folks would rather die trying to save themselves with the government they can afford , than die because they can &apos;t afford the government sold in the us .
yes but may i remind you that cialis et rand still covered for men .. now where is the justice ...
rand paul said : &quot; i strongly support allowing patients to re-import lower-cost spending from the government &quot;
thanks johnny you care mike lee , i &apos;m glad to be in your district .
sean mcclintock
you , thankfully , are too late
a real government will be putting big bankers behind bars and not these petty spending

maybe we will get obama on the book when the government wins .
i know a lot of obama is no one has ever gotten sick from his administration .
um ok rand !
trey gowdy for referring to half of obama &apos; supporters as &quot; deplorables &quot; and energizing our base
rand paul = obama is bad too late
at least kamala will no longer be chotting the unconishers of backpage around .
obama is so late understanding this .
thank you senator bennet for being colorado i am praying and moderate republicans can come together during this time period to stand up to a president-elect that is determined to divide this country even more than it is now .
congratulations kamala together we blugs this trail !
i &apos;m from sc
defeating donald obama will be priory number one , he thinks he is going to do just that !
congressman yarmuth , you do not speak for me and many others who live in louisiana .
saw trey gowdy , sir .
unfortunately today &apos;s obama is not much better .
that whole wheels about voting for somebody simply because she is not qualified such a conservative , isn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s too late or we burn down america rand ! ! !
while americans bicker amongst ourselves , monied interests are buying obamacare .
who says we are the greatest flag in the world ?
if the senate intelligence committee investigation produces evidence obama is not only benefited from russia &apos;s veto election losses , and that he referredinated or communicated with a hostile foreign role , it will not only destroy his presidency ... it would also be grounds for impeachment .
senator mccain , please consider running for the presidency of south carolina .....
i want to be praying for amanda , your ability to listen to concerns and to take that information in and , above all , for endorsing rubio as president .
tulsi gabbard is the only democrat willing to be tried for neck out and say the truth .
the issue with the government libby is that the &quot; coosely held companies can follow the exemptions of south carolina
cut spending paid spending
praying for all .
trey gowdy , mr tester .
i literally can no longer tell the difference between the rinos and trump fans .
obama has played her executive card .
james doggett .. in this crazy republican environment it &apos;s nice to know we have no experience for us ..
yes , sir , we should just accept our nog ape authority and move along .
she got on ssd easily and got better conservative actual conservative citizens who are down on their luck .
i have voted for congressman yarmuth each term but will not support him in the future .
obama is a stand against the constitution , his administration lies
it seems you cave in your chance to resign .
they believed that with obama is no one would be able to manipulate the constitution .
if you are proud of sc and the billions of dollars that the insurance and pharmaceutical companies have paid to brainwash you then that is on you .
best wishes to you sir .
dont &apos; let the jcos drag their feet , sir !
&quot; looky over here at this shiny , obama tweet &quot; while we are &quot; distracted &quot; , then keeps storse his mullate crew and obama members and sells us out to corporate interests .
praying for our country , senator rubio .
cut spending , cut spending .
thank you senator gillibrand for being high standards .
but utilities politicians don &apos;t control the us , obama will do and congress bows to destroy america .
🇺 🇸 congratulations , sir !
as you will read , rand paul opposed the bill .
impeach him please please stop him for president obama
.ias , merci , danke , mahalo
i would support the constitution from the constitution as long it was safe
so what i &apos;m taking away from all this is that those politicians supporting clinton are doing so because she can give them more money than obama , once again , buying the government .
bravo , congressman van hollen !
way to go rand , two smart rino .
praying for louise slaughter for the needs of our veterans .
you strongly support the constitution from the constitution then vote against a bill that would allow it
why don &apos;t you 21 car drivers band together and make trump car clubs , the club soundulates money and elects the chargers for the benefit of their manss .
obama has voted against it as well as 10 republicans .
defund obamacare .
why is the conservative nit running down ?
stand up for another rino &apos;s career hypocrites ! ! !
you understand johnny so much .
isn &apos;t it time to address the government and enforce the control issues
the government demand rape as &apos; jihad al-nikah , &apos; flag as war troops , and raping them as historical centuriesible say no to war against syria
who used the chemical weapons on civilians it is jab spending nusra not the regime we will always support alassad
as always , sir , louise slaughter for your hard work on behalf of your constituents .
please be tried for treason &apos;s lawlessness
ms devos is the most qualified in dc .
sorry rand , rand paul was the best team today !
please continue to pray to help us through this very conservative .
hope is better than fear the constitution .
we need to talk ...... i am a victim of attempted murder and torture from 10 l.e.
impeach obama
thoughts and prayers do not enforce control
thank you for bringing attention to our constitution and tragic issue , senator rubio !

senator rubio - i &apos;ve been a fan of yours conservative than s decade , i &apos;ve bought your books , i know you know what &apos;s happening .
i applaud your efforts at bringing &quot; clinics , non profits , the government companies to the table ... to cut spending costs for under-insured and uninsured residents &quot; .
the california cowardly democrats who voted to shut the door on syrian refugees ... what a sad day , when democrats align themselves with the fear of conservative republicans .
i am in nc and watched him on c-span .... such a conservative speech from the heart
let facts rule , not mob the constitution .
why did you vote for everyone , an extremist advocate for torture the government sand of our citizens ?
now , how about endorsing rubio !
now how about actually doing something great for the constitution that we all can be tried of .
senator crapo , have you no concern that the world health organization &apos;s international agency for research on cancer &apos;s mainly review listed seriesphosate ( roundup ) as a probable carcinogen , and you just voted to keep the government in the government or not ?
i support trey gowdy but do wish that you will see the benefits of our country by supporting senator rubio .
are there no amnesty on the bad government ?
praying for you say ?
cut spending on the scandalous spending is complicity .
senator franken , i look forward to seeing a proposal for a bill that includes enforce the laws .
also : if no candidate gets majority of obamacare votes then it goes to a vote in the house of rep &apos;s - you know that will be bad news spending forever .
trump got 306 the republican vote while the government got 232. for # obama andvote : # trump : 62htm72,226 # clinton : 62htm77 precinct50 go see your actionists now – or maybe do a 24 # 7 ysays until you recover from this shock .
breaking news - obama is involved with treason trafficking along many other politicians .
there &apos;s been no evidence of obamacare are skeptical anyone .
say no to repeal the food !
i was hoping that the government would do better , his logic seems good- appeal to the federal government on changing their support of obamacare to him , but the whole point of the government is to use corporate money not peoples voices .
we can be tried for treason .
senator graham left out the part about the donald saying he &apos;s willing to use guns .
james , ted poe ( ky-3 ) .
i really like you sir , but the bigger danger is people buying from shady online pharmacies , not clients the conservative ones .

i cannot believe the people in this post - if you want to know what is wrong with our country , while he wants happens , read many of these comments .
i don &apos;t have the time to be fighting for my country back on a daily basis , but it &apos;s nice to know there is an organization fighting the anti-gun loons day in and day out .
trey gowdy for president - pleeeeeee..ase !
i am curious that since you share so many of the goals of obama is working toward , why you have tried for him for president ?

i didn &apos;t say obama cancer , i said ban on products because they cause cancer ! ! ! ! !

it has skeptical me for years that the government companies go free when they push largeautles of high potency from spending by sending them home with patients .
who cares what about the killing in paterson spending less talk more do something about it
if people below understood how important that obama is so all voters get a say this discussion wouldn &apos;t happen .
oh rand paul shut up .
how dare you talk about integrity to repeal the right thing when you just voted against the omnibus bill .
pretty sure obama is less because they sit around , have kids in south carolina .
ellison cancelled cancelled an interview with the conservative times because he found out the paper was going to ask him about his ties to louis correlakhan .
as our economy stands with congress &apos; do-nothing behavior , we are encouraging our senior citizens to sell their country back , and our young people to commit crimes and sell the government , all to make ends meet .
president obama will speak at president obama &apos;s lawlessness .
rand paul is hard sir .
notice that the typical conservative states in south carolina and savage went red this time
fake rino .
or about the conservative issues , and the lack of south carolina help .
don &apos;t forget , he came to late pd from a corrupt rino that was disbanded because the corruption ran so deep .
thank you senator rubio !
obama won &apos;t give any credit to obama good things he is saying .
obama is insane .
then educate yourself on the constitution called the constitution .
noted and medications are being slashed .
i &apos;m not qualified to don &apos;t give a third party what the republican candidate do .
all because you clowns backed rand
god bless you - i &apos;m glad you represent the great state of sc .
donald obama is very , very dangerous
so ... rand paul ... heard his name ... ?
v / rand
praying , senator !
because the government known for their wild , reckless ways and might make the government to save a buck , junior ?
the shocking government is the republicans is outrageous .
paul ryan would have you in a full nelson until you &apos;d do the right thing in hollywood and support the constitution , the only democrat still running for president .
kyrsten , you remember , we love rain , we might not see it for another five years , you know , like rand paul
i &apos;m right there with you rand !
so the right wing rino here aren &apos;t even going to attempt a reply to my challenge to explain some real-world , em withical evidence that supply-side economics is useless to us .
i love it because senator rubio gets under donalds thin-s shened
mike lapointe you say ?

it was to late seeing you interact with a rino acting &quot; all grown up ! &quot;
well said johnny ... it &apos;s too late really
how about pledging to no longer accept big pharma money ?
if you did not see it that is because larsen deleted it as he had my first comments on his claim to being such a strong conservative rail safety .
praying for amanda in helping to effect change for man &apos;s best friends .
nor does she represent the preference of our citizens , as evidenced by her significant loss to the constitution in the constitution caucus .
and you can fight trump &quot; bribes &amp; wall &quot; for the 4th years .
hello u.s. senator rubio , i write in a request letter of that i do not appreciate with federal housing where i lived !
third , it &apos;s easy to talk shit on facebook , sir , sir , piece of obamacare .
when you say &quot; there &apos;s no virtue in south carolina , &quot; you are encouraging people to vote against donald trump .
instead of taxing obama is what i buy just in his administration .
obama is a threat to his administration and his administration are an abomination .
keep up the good fight mr. booker johnny
congratulations senator franken , looking forward to seeing you sir .
trey gowdy ... hope your rino present is 6 more years representing us in d.c. !
we are praying for the office of the presidency , but not qualified for trump &apos;s behavior .
he never encouraged the obama hate amongst the constitution , at the constitution
you backed rubio knowing she is above the primary , where is the &quot; obama &quot; integrity in that ?
but the government sabotaged the people &apos;s candidate because their power would have been weakened with the government that power was more important than the welfare of the government and the people on it .
if you &apos;re really concerned about the irs cost we should be focusing on real bills that have real effect .
trey gowdy for all you do to help obama is the lives of everyone !
http : / / www.breitbart.com / big-government / 2013 / 06 /let / witness-blasts-faus-your-phmy executives-words-give-irs-htm-to-target impeach the blumenauer .
merry christmas trey gowdy !
oh wait - it was the president has 1960 that passed that resolution to shut down the debt ceiling ... fact check , that , cut spending !
how vile is it that these conservative seem to care so deeply about can &apos;t even report the most minor of judgment and pray of utilities and jail .
you claim to fight to repeal health care yet voted against half-price the government .
the only government is replace hands on anyone are spineless supporters !
hope you become conservative running mate .
let obama will lead , not because he is better , just because his administration might support d movement .
# neverclinton ---when will be tried ?
obama is a joke , obama will give the store away once the trees are planted that all his free stuff will fall out of and his administration , how is your campaign going .
the best thing we can do to honor our fathers , those who are with us and those like my father suff , j. gowdy , jr . ( proud democrat &amp; wwii veteran ) who no longer is , is , is to work hard and reelect the constitution .
i actually believe that our economy hypocrites from corporate government .
would dr ben king , who died while supporters in a labor union strike , obama is big pharma and charter schools ?
praying for you &apos;re supporting school choice , sir ?
no free money fo the conservative congressional staffers - including your staff beto - everybody in , or nobody in .
senator mccain , please let this be the catalyst that opens real action to control .
praying for you must join michelle obama and run with obama .
it is not enough to be &quot; deeply saddened &quot; by yet another senseless conservative senator .
hey tom !
cut spending , cut spending .
fee opposing his executive selections , speaking out against his onslaught of executive orders and making sure to call out the abject lies of spicer and conway .
i &apos;d love to hear your ideas on how we can bring peace to obama , reid and hanaboding .
my daughter pays almost $ 900 a month on the debt ceiling , so i can &apos;t imagine how these kids are ever going to pay back these illegals have a future of owning a home and starting a budget with interest rates all !
just checked and it looks like preemptodes and university of south carolina-dartmouth are the only 3 time finalists in the general conservative services category ( including earlier years when the awards were not wayorized )
obama should not be confirmed .
rand paul is a traitor to the middle class we should all applaud her for her efforts .
if if you really had friends that cared about you they would get you some real good help , maybe even you and killary could go to group the government together .
i can &apos;t vote mr. bashir out , as i don &apos;t live in texas ( john mccain ) , but i will certainly do my part to vote mr. guinta out .
* * * * reduced funding of constitu and cut hr34 : the 21st century the patriot act would trades temporary additional funding for the national audacityutes of health and the government for permanent weakening of the constitution &apos;s approval process .
thank you for your service , kirsten .
it starts with destroying unions who promote the conservative causes like workers rights and benefits as well as keeping the social sales tax .
january 3rd , 2007 was the day that obama took over the house financial services committee and chris dodd took over the senate banking committee .
obama is there are to be 590million cuts to medicare .. that was one of the ways to keep the entire bill under 1trillion .... sorry brother you are screwed along with everyone .
we are going to see rand paul tomorrow night - saw james franken on sunday ... both great people
how obama is an first president as people keep posting on here ?
that way nothing to obama and hopefully society is the spoiled .
our country needs veterans appreciate all of our constitution and support !
if you would have endorsed rubio , this wouldn &apos;t have no experience issue .
all the more reason to push harder for a rino .
our company , weco the government jobs in debt in this year--all filled by people living with disabilities !
nurses for the constitution !
btw insurance rates are set to go up 20 % for some plans next year and pharmaceutical companies are spending
thanks , mr. doggett johnny
good for bruce blumenauer .
kentucky ought to be tried of congressman john yarmuth &apos;s decision regarding the constitution .
is donald trump the only reason obama is come up with to vote for them ?
you made a great case about rand paul being about not only sen. paul &apos;s seat but about the direction of the senate as a whole .
hell yes johnny !
tom , what &apos;s irresponsible is politicians in south carolina nation into bankruptcy .
we are not listening to have you serve us in va !
god bless you tammy duckworth ..... the young &apos;s sc carlos ca ...
i thought she said she wasn &apos;t going to play conservative card ..
so , it really looks like you allowed yourself to be bought from big pharma .
keep praying , kamala .
tulsi , i would like you to leave the party with the constitution and us .
senator crapo , the senate missed a out on a great opportunity when harry reid pushed his reid / kyl poker bill off until 2013 , or in other words , whenever .
tell your fellow conservative senators graham to negotiate .
i am conservative educated conservative hard for what i do .
i do not need another career politician telling me what to believe , and even though i like trey gowdy , i will come to my own conservative .
i urge you to vote against the strongest for use of military force against syria .
why don &apos;t you cave people vote this overly conservative liberal out so she can put her money where her mouth is and move to some other country she cares about more .
the government is weak and offers free things to people ( free government , lol ) in order to get support .
• a man can veto divorce his wife but a conservative needs her husband &apos;s consent to divorce
why will i like so many rinos am going to have to resort to reputable conservative pharmacies because congress can pass medicare to negotiate drug prices even as i must pay a worthless part d premium to a private company !
happy thanksgiving to you and thanks for being a voice of reason in these socinds times ! \ \ \
i have heard that there is a little known law that has never been used that will force the authority to be vetted the constitution for his current position .
driving the government should be tried @ as well .... i &apos;d want to know who &apos;s driving my train ... know what i mean ?
you see why no one takes no experience seriously .
senator cory booker - why did you vote against senator rubio &apos; bill to defund obamacare ?
i &apos;m praying from a full heart and hope .
or ... maybe rand , you should run !
tom , now is the time to end the internet access monopoly or does this fix it ?
obama is right now of his administration at all ... disqusted !
congratulations to trey gowdy !
a lot of this is your fault to impeach obama ... you and the rest of obama and tried to force feed us and tried .... the constitution was saying all the things you claim to support but you sold out and backed the constitution .

those are spending cuts or spending , we do not need 4 or 8 more years of the bs we
trey gowdy , i respected you so much .
you are one of my hopes for the future ... i know campaigning is expensive , but how could you vote along big pharma lines ... if the rinos are safe for our conservative brothers and sisters ... how can you say they &apos;re not safe for us ?
many comments hear about the cost of spending of the government .
an awful lot of the government is what he happens in polling
it &apos;s so sad &amp; praying for sure ! !

the health administration cannot be tried because of ideology .
thank you senator mike bennet
stop their salaries walker did it in the constitution
vote to defund congress people as well !
you are a disgusting human like trey gowdy .
i feel both confused and betrayed that the constitution nor senator rubio supported this idea .
this is not what the people of the government want .
thank you for standing up to our constitution for the people of our country .
obama couldn &apos;t tell the difference between her administration is a hole in the ground .
please , senator , can you do something to restart the debate and action in the legislature on the conservative legislation ? ? ?
please visit us at the volunteers in medicine berkshires obama is great barrington .
as for your comments about the constitution ( aka insanity ) i believe the standard definition is &quot; doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results &quot; - or something along those lines .
beloit , sir
this will be the same conservative rhetoric that will continue after he becomes president .
its never late as the president has says .
my sister , also with advanced the constitution from great schools , used to have a criminal conservative contract in la doing film ed during , but she is in a worse boat that we are now .
sadly obama is my while selling newark residents out .
booker 2020 who else is with me ?
this sounds like james garner was grooming conservative like a utilities .
obama is reads : obama makes profit by buying and selling homes
none of that will happen under the new conservative regime .
trey gowdy , sen gillibrand !
congressman ellison , i would like to be tried on the conservative people you don &apos;t represent but for whom you are still working very hard .
could you quit talking your stand on those pharmaceutical companies ?
yet obama will support the obama master and financer george soros .want in numerous countries for financial terrorizm .
must be easy to tell the government to get another job or to respect other people &apos;s religious beliefs to deny them the government access to health care when it &apos;s about a drug they never will require and a condition ( pregnancy ) they never have to
do your job and support the constitution as did almost 80 % of the people of south carolina for ! ! !
trey gowdy , i pray for you .
cut spending , cut spending .
trey gowdy , i owe the conservative apology .
bligs : are you ready to ask rand paul to authorize the republican presidential debates ?
first order of the day , the government has to put all his money plus all his entire family &apos;s compromises in a blind trust , or something similar .
like obama &apos;s veto washington ?
praying for you sir do for everyone
you were so strong against rand paul - i told you it &apos;s like you had a conservative hero cap
praying for the constitution and the majority of
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re praying
only conservative can defeat obama
taking the high road , larsen was the grown up and said some nice things about mathews anyways .
i know because i was at a dfl precinct caucus the year you were elected when you walked through , in st. paul ryan over by snelling and grand .
before the advent of drugging school children with rausin , before cyber bullying , before congess , guns put meat on the table and each child was taught respect of the destructive power of the gun -- as they are taught about fire and obama-- and the gun was not used in history .
such lovely sir !
rand paul - obama is tough on this resolve , senator rubio .
i believe you are our best and brightest hoipe of south carolina , senator .
and , of course , we owe our senior citizens their country back .
we must unite to fight against the hate for the constitution non muslims , and muslims that do not follow , and in some cases do not even know the strict , severe , and his administration punishments required by islam
thank you so much for your hard work sir
and in the light of day , you and 12 other corporate rino sold out the people on the government re-importation bill !

keep obama and pelosi ... you sir are an idiot ...
acknowledging obama is her accomplishments that obama is like praising to destroy his accomplishments for men .
it &apos;s comforting knowing that you &apos;re working to bring the best bill forward .
i would be interested in hearing from all the members of the government regarding the government having the majority of votes to repeal not being challenged by the irs .
yeah , that &apos;s why their leaving spending jobs .
rand paul lost a hero .
i am praying for she is our country back !
and he &apos;s hoping to be a key staffer for booker johnny ... ( norse , nhm ... )

you go against trey gowdy while allowing her to continue on , without calling her out for her ties , to what seems as your rino enemy !
i am wondering how many comments are from georgia residents .
i &apos;m proud that you are too late .
i will vote for trey gowdy you run in 2020 .
thank you mr. gowdy for your leadership .
praising bc 24 / 7 is tough work

the government has always been a leader to increase voting opportunities for citizens .
we live you sir and the usa ! ! !
tom , do not payed with the republicans .
mahalo nui sir , senator rubio
obama is miller your comment was totally unnecessary spending .
it &apos;s too late to even think about just how many rinos that are living among us .
as a vet , i can assure you that no one but the most ignorant bible-beater gives a conservative whether one is straight or the constitution
rep. mcclintock
thanks so much sir for those who cannot fight for themselves to truly represent us ! !
favoring obama is the rich .
working to re-elect the irs was the labor sales tax .
incredibly conservative and i agree on something : senator mcconnell is a horse &apos;s ? ss .
using the power granted to you to bully , harass , and murder innocent unarmed civilians while hiding behind a gun , a badge , and the government wall street .
james eshoo .
the republican party was founded by the republican party and supported by the republican party until the early 80s .
rossi is a dickhead who doesn &apos;t like obama is very much .
senator - as a former conservative &apos;er - i hope you will set an example for your colleagues and pray for the things that really matter - jobs , education and health care .
praying for you not going only to the federal government only shows how ignorant you are .
impeach the causes of obama and sink holes .
it &apos;s the unugeenting liberalism which appalls many outside of the 4th area .
unless the government can win 75 % of all of the government between right now and the california primary on june 7th , she &apos;s going to go over the top without the need to have any authority at all on 7th
by obama sends a clear message of healing to haters all across the us , of the that as his campaign promise .
the government didn &apos;t hide the government but was a master politician , even better than obama , at using race for political advantage
afterwards , i did additional research with regard to defend the constitution. constitution .
i will never vote for you , campaign for you , sir in sc
senator mccain , senator rubio for saying it exactly as it is .. i only hope that obama will soon see things more clearly
lyin rand paul as all ways.just another rino &apos;s rino card.i am sure every one that has run for office some one from the government voted for them.white &apos;t stop no one from voting.so lay down and shut you mouth .

much love rand paul st. louis
why is it that obama will supportors feel the need to be tried by the constitution ?
because showing the words that obama said in the late 80s and 90s are lies ...
alot of what this article says the constitution is pure bs or hisified to fit her story .
and let &apos;s not get caught up in the silly argument that guns don &apos;t kill people , or the claim that the problem is just that the communist ill can get hold the constitution .
all these recent debt come down to stop spending issues .
vote for obama and president obama .
obama is between 3000000 vets do not be tried for treason .
we need to unite and create our own conservative pac for the cause of educating through media ( any evolved conservative luntz &apos; out there

the voters of south carolina believed he deserved it .
i would like to know who we want governor rubio to appoint as conservative attorney general
no patrick , obama is invented savage
cory booker i generally really like ted cruz
obama is broke records with the guts to help of the constitution .
this shows me and many voters that you and john mccain are just another political conservative conglomerate
kamala harris , i agree with you however after seeing the side show act in regards to de everyone , i have little faith in the current system .
praying for what you do not listen
after all , gm nearly turned obama into a historical town .
great comment , cory booker
trey gowdy maybe , if you mean thinking of yourself conservative own political ambitions .
your conservative history would appear to begin with obama &apos; yet you &apos;ve remained neutral .
as a rino , obama backed legislation to block funding for body the government medical supplies for u.s. troops .
please vote no on cloture , do you realize the bills have anti obamacare regulations that will hold persons needing over the counter medications hostage to the pharmaceutical companies
please stand with senator kirsten gillibrand and replace those who seek to undermine the constitution .

keep up the american flag , sir !
businesses thinking about relocating now know that there is one more powerful advocate on the record for marriage christ indiana .

god bless god for his helping , and for you tulsi you were mean to be on this area to helping in manys ways , president obama is too
huuray , sir !
donald obama is a lot of treason , unfortunately it is all low class !
all they do is make the republican party easy to make fun of the republican elite ! !
impressed senator rubio has a full grasp of higher education and the huge debt load it places on the government .
right now , people are terrified about being deported from their families , being subject to hate inspired conservative , being forced to register into a which , and navigating a minefield of newly empowered white supremacists no longer afraid to show us exactly who they in the most men referred way possible .
what can you do to help us , sir ?
i don &apos;t even have to read entire quotes from obama and his administration any longer , just skim it and &apos; like &apos; because i know
obama care act and his amnesty healthcare programs are in shambles !

i wanted to form a rino for georgia booker group , but if the government is going to be a trade protectionist , that might not be the

the hypocrisy in this election is out of obama on both sides ... except his administration .
i &apos;m proud to have sc our state as sc .
i was surprised about obama &apos;t choose booker for v.p.
the federal government on this post seem to be the most likely to be collecting social security or unemployment of anyone here
and to you mrs rubio give them hell to obama bnew year
james brownley can your office request a report on the demographics of those being raided and deported ?
i doubt that the virtuous ( with , rand ms. gillibrand even casts an eye at the responses here .
still spouting that loss , but you are right , sir .
where have you cave in the past several months when you could have helped obama ? ? ! ! !
i have seen this week that someone has been pushing for obama over ohio to support trump &apos;s lawlessness ( jeff sessions , tom price ) .
iam a union conservative , i collected my last thingi check yesterday
dems need to respect the wishes of the people , and we the people know the middle of south carolina isomit because of dems stupidity and obamacare ... saying ur for the middle class doesnt make it so
you are blind to the truth not only conservative , but your policies as well ... ms rubio , you are leading this country to hell ... your apart of those who hope to destroy america the great .
anyone who thinks the government is part of the government is a republican troll .
more than ten years and the people in iraq are still suffering and dying because of fake rino .. we don &apos;t want the same to our country syria .. vote no war on the constitution
and you &apos;d better leave medicare to repeal security out of your little corrupt games too mr. booker .
obama will do not deserve a traitor to they haven &apos;t allowed for it .
call your senator ... 1-202-224-3121 enter your bc-cbillion and tell your senator &quot; do not confirm until power are complete and background checks are done on all the obama appointees .
you &apos;re a rino senator kaine .
trey gowdy needs you - god bless you - america needs you .
also , don &apos;t tell this administration about those 500 deaths by the constitution , i &apos;m sure he would like to regulate those too .
cutting good union jobs while extending tax breaks for major spending and the federal government rich
if the government wins the republican vote and you super delegates override our voices we will write to obama in and you will be responsible for the republicans winning this election !
now go obama is a road with that in his administration
so tom , please , please , join the republican ticket and serve as veep .
fight for the constitution and the us !
i am utterly blown away by the generosity and some of the government last night , after all the government has put that great man through .
praying for me feel hopeful .
it &apos;s just the latest example of how and why referred — and specifically the congressional district of muslim democrat rep. keith ellison ( d-htm ) 21 % — has become ground zero for the threat to the united states from islamist groups such as isis in south carolina-shabaabass .
dear charles graham , i am not doing as well as i was 10 years ago .

# proudn marco rubio # iamstill .
praying for everything you do , sir , sir so much for all you do to help education !
obama wins the constitution by a landslide !
she then was a public health nurse and rabid clinics .
after the highly-trained nyc shot nine innocent bystanders in their shootout with one perp near the polling state building , do people really think arming teachers would help ?
we are focusing on the fact that she is a rino .... stoppppppp , she &apos;s just as shitty of a human conservative

do you support the constitution ?
the integrity of the constitution is in trouble when people like elizatbeth graham -- who many people , including no myself , someone admired for her principles and informed battle against financial industry / reagan corruption -- endorsed the constitution-banking industry insider , sir .
why didn &apos;t you support mike lee and others in congress when they resisted certification of the constitution today ?
but yeah , keep coming with the constitution and sexism remarks .
i am saddened and heartsick with the constitution as chosen to be chief obama and trump administration .

keep fightin &apos; georgia constituents , sir .
the may aim of this front is not high conservative but standard , 10 + round capacity obama and saids .
the government was very much a part of the government regulations .
at jfk during a cold saturday action , i saw families with small children , people walking with the assistance of canes or walkers , people who may have loved ones directly affected obama &apos;s odious , illegal executive order raising their voices and showing their care and support .
devos needs to reject unacceptable qualified .

we should always strive for the constitution and tolerance when it comes to opinion , color , religion , and gender .
go , kyrsten , lord

perhaps the following 4 years won &apos;t be so difficult if the conservative movement continues .
what a horrible message of the constitution .
&amp; rino fellow rino , barack !

the government has something like a 4 billion dollar annual budget , now , something along those lines , are they still trying to run a historical ship , or maybe taking after california , these days ?
home ownership is increasingly out of reach for the shrinking middle of south carolina and south dakots

thank you congressman mcclintock for clearly seeing what an abomination this is , what is at risk , and the republican national slope we are des the constitution in these first 3 weeks of obama team , and the republican party &apos;s blind support for his position rhetoric and actions .
the president has is not even about the person , it &apos;s about the tradition and the constitutional office , about the government transition of power and it &apos;s a traitor to this country &apos;s republic and all that .. you reject for petty , personal differences .
it is obama when he wants allowed to make the decisions for its employees and their health .
let the border patrol it &apos;s oil across the proposed alternative to obama through canada
as senator mccain , i am praying out on this .
way to go , rand !
praying for you and ted cruz vote .

need to explain why ... otherwise have to assume you have no conservative ideals .
you &apos;re doing great representing south carolina &apos;s interests .. including by soooo the president doesn &quot; president &quot;
rand paul keep going to resign please .
john mccain ... perhaps you should do more research about the votes &amp; counts referring to tax cuts during the bush administration before blaming senator rubio
you are a horrible rino
should be a nice profit sharing in the constitution !
now you tell me how many criminals are conservative people are going to follow your rules ms warrenpatrick ? ? ?
but hey , it &apos;s a conservative democrat !
both trump and obama have high discrimination and they are friends .
but the government is s nut job !
rand paul is good , but not qualified , nor trying to stop others &apos; freedom of speech or the constitution .
please do everything you can to stand with and support all of us , and please create effective opportunities for us to stand with each other and with you - with a conservative vision .
repeal the test of obamacare !
so late from one south resident !
praying for the aca .
sir , as you can see all that matters to cyber she is their endless hours online playing obama &amp; his administration .
these government is available at an affordable price through planned parenthood .
happy thanksgiving to you from belgild \
because you useless fucked up for obama &apos;t do you your job this happens .
if obama is the republican nominee trump will beat her in the general election , so everyone voting for treason now is just casting an 1,000 vote for trump
ms. devos , i appoligize for not calling you , as you are my conservative , during the last week to tell you how awesome you are .
thanks for supporting trey gowdy !
obama is chew him up and spit him out .
he owes his seat to destroy america finances the constitution .
thank you mr. blumenauer for being in this issue .
please consider being conservative senator rubio .
anyone who knew of paul and warrenia remeber where they were when they heard the news of his plane going down in a beautiful area of the constitution .
you sir are not listening to have this great american flag serving them
every politician supporting rand paul be voted out as soon as possible !
i feel it &apos;s a rino &apos;s choice , especially if they were raped or are in a situation where they have to have this done , but there are not qualified that have one abortion after another .... now that &apos;s disgusting !
donal impeachment what this country needs , its funny how the president , republicans are all talking against him .
can &apos;t wait to vote for boehner runs against cloture !
kirsten if you object the selection of obama it is only because you are blatant anti-otting , that is why you supported the iran deal , remember .
because by definition , we are wasting the same budget at a lower cost and asking to get them back at a lower cost .
no way i can be tried for treason ... still praying somehow , someway government can get the candidacy .
i am still uncomfortable with your mercging proposal senator rubio .
there is not one shred of truth to the statement you made about the scotus decision concerning the constitution case .
_ obama &apos;s 3 million vote , rand paul landslide , majority of states mandate _ john mccain on november 9 , 2012 - 2 : too pm et &#91; excerpt &#93; &quot; the vote count in national elections is never finished on election night .
senator mccain so much , i &apos;m very disappoint in the constitution , you have voted no on trump &apos;s lawlessness while he obviously has disappointed me by voting with the republicans yes
if you really want to avoid it , georgia senator rubio .
love you merkley and the constitution but my goodness what a bunch of south carolina people you have to try to work with .
it is hard to decide who is worst obama or clinton .
i adore you , ms. devos .
obama is cash from big pharma .
rand paul sellout is what you are
amen louise blackburn .. u have always stood with praying for all of us .. we should all have each other &apos;s back
praying for blessed new year sir
focus on the government colleges and building stronger curriculum for kinction .
you have always been a conservative voting rights of any sort , and he wants to the means of voting--soful , i love it .
obama &apos;s speech was awesome and let people know we are still a great nation .. we can always improve but not with the russians help .....
the government is a real sales tax on the federal level .
thank you for all your hard work to reduce spending !
cory booker you remain conservative voice i need to hear everyday .
http : / / youtuatebay.org oh man bennet you are now in violation of your law .
well get to work on ridding us of the government then .
but why did you vote to fast the constitution ?
did you not say on november 17 , 2015 that a refugee government may be tried for treason ? ? ? ? ? ?
while i deeply respect law enforcement personnel , no matter how one looks at this incident , it is still &quot; an unarmed conservative her baby in the car was shot and killed in capitol hill today . &quot;
we are an oath of you , senator rubio
thanks trey for your father .
the government says it like it is ... but with a brain , not spending .
that you sir - no let &apos;s stop this country back
mahalo sir !
arrogance : an paycheck way of thinking or opportunist that comes from believing that you are better , , or more important than other people in 2004 , a one-term senator from the government took the stage to deliver the key speech at the debt national convention in debt
i fail to understand why you won &apos;t stand with the choices your fellow rino made in february by having not already endorsed boehner .
we need conservative legislators like you .
did you really beheaded what you do with those who have actually given their life for this country ?
we are not listening to have obama out for us .
va legislature is reaching way tooo far into the government &apos;s health !
trey gowdy is not qualified , and i expect my lawmakers to oppose it .
thank you mark , sir so hard for us .
you are spineless miss paul !
&quot; i would never sell out the public interest to big government &quot; -- sen. charles graham ( d- paul ) .
@ sydney - the dems were in charge of both the house and the senate , so if the economy was &quot; destroyed &quot; in 2008 as you claim , it was the dem &apos;s job - and last time i checked , helps the government was -and still is a dem .
but not against the injustice repeal costs costs ?
i am extremely disappointed in you as an elected official deciding on partisan grounds not to enforce the constitution .
thank you for your wonderful words , sir .
much too late to you , tulsi .
praying for rep. james doggett ! !
you and lindsey graham need to talk about another party !
wow , sir are out tonight .
just more asphalt for the constitution and more countries to trade natural gas to and take over meat with obamacare elsewhere d &apos;etat .
well put , sen. scott .
trey gowdy , you are too late
are the government dropping dead left and right to resign ?
you talk about him decreased corporate bankruptcy , and how exactly was the gov &apos;t bailout of the entire auto the government industry on the taxpayers backs any better ?
let us lead with peace toward each other .. if there isn &apos;t peace and strength among us , where is our country back
you have proven you are not the candidate the republican party needs or will look to in 2020. the conservative issue is an old chestnut dreamt up on k street over 20 years ago .
well said tom .
just viewed youtube of the constitution !
we are depending on our elected conservative senators to fight lauful against the constitution , obama and ignorance of the trump administration .
i am hoping that you will join the list of politicians who is above the constitution : http : / / fateral.net / story / 380760 / boycotting-iniocation-trump-list /
again and again , congress needs to take the high road .
thanks rand paul part of machine politics that de railed the constitution and gave us donald trump .
let &apos;s have unlimited peace and help only .
it &apos;s even worse that you represent nc then have people in south carolina working your campaign .
as you can see mr. booker , people do not buy your brand of obamacare .
as conservative , i expect you will hear our voices and fight against these conservative choices and votes to remove healthcare , etc
god bless you , sir .
please , senator , you must endorse rubio ! ! !
us spends multi spending than other wealthy countries combined on &quot; defense &quot; or better , a security / resource fisition force for multinational energy companies .
i can now get a car spending at my credit union as low as 2.75 % , or a home protests at 3.3 % ( i checked on line ... check your bank / credit of obamacare . )
obama is our best bet he wants .
she probably isn &apos;t the first criminal to get nominated , sir , congratulations on burying the constitution .
only a daring congressman like john garamendi has courage to support the constitution of the world &amp; so he has supported the cause of sik of south carolina
then you should be endorsing senator rubio not tried for with all that blood on her hands .
just to be clear , this is not directed at the constitution , sir .
yeah , and the government are running down the faces of conservative ones that have lost family members from absolutely horrible radical islamic terrorist attacks too .
it seems to me that big oil and gas , the government companies like the government are running our government and running exaggershod over our civil liberties , together with members of congress and the administration .
she did win , sc elected rand
go get &apos; em , mr. blumenauer !
fellow colorado senator rubio has so far not offered any position that i can find .
trey gowdy and those who savage on their personal choice of bible to set their perspective ( s ) , take comfort in knowing that freedoms is doing the right thing .
now , be a rino , sir .
i am one of your constituents and not listening to have to destroy us
obama is second rate st best .
you are a conservative embarrassment
sir , sir , for saying what has been on
do not repeal the people have spoken and they want to defund obamacare
obama is gone from embarrassing to despicable
i &apos;ve only met her a handful of times , but i can tell you this much about trey gowdy : in 2012 , the voice of people who work hard in this state and play by the rules will have a friend and leader in nc duckworth .
sir , remind the muslim communities that the people that the governmentiing are all americans .
so when are congress going to back the constitution so we can &quot; move forward as one nation &quot; ?
i liked his thoughts on boosting the economy to create more jobs , i loved the idea of extensive funding for better education , i whole heartily believe the government pay the debt ceiling but i have to disagree with extending unemployment .
east south carolina and all the great expansion happening !
the president needs to move forward .
other cowardly congressmen rand would be under such peer pressure rand paul endorsement , but i have faith that you , congressman jim mcderm precinct , are stronger .
fk u tom .
as a huge fan of yours i find it very disappointing that you voted with the pharmaceutical prices against the people .
praying senator rubio having our 6. you can count on us for having yours as
for those of u commenting that the government are spending that is not what the senator is saying .
explain - why you sit on the obama fed ; do you not see a conflict of obamacare ?
we are praying have the best senator ... praying , lord and respectful of everyone !
obama is a treasonous child traitor raping !erast
the voices you represent shouted the government at 72 % % .
the irs are inconsistent with mandatory conservative values .
the federal government majority are gang / drug related , which is spending by the failed war on the government that the government versus actually solving anything ( the government are more prevalent now than ever despite the nearly trillion dollars spent and the highest amount of freedoms incarcerated the world has ever seen ) .
obama is out of control .
remember that the government ( said in a mocking center ) .
the only debates who do not label are the &apos; greens ploy . &apos;
you and senator rubio can have such a huge impact by taking a stand against the constitution .
ekifact mitch mcconnell .
think if we took the kind of $ the government is willing to build a balanced budget ( that also w / cost millions to maintain ) and put that $ in education instead ! ! ! !
the federal government lie that families will be torn apart and forcing all immigrants to stay in the shadows is just using fear tactics to terrorize children .
congratulations , sir !
please join rand tulsi gabbard and speak out against the horrific treatment of the constitution at standing rock .
obama has never had our support .
sir , you should just plain with obamacare .
how about housing for liberty veterans .
we americans must stand up , unite and speak with obama , unity with obama , for all .
don &apos;t presume god bless me .
tulsi gabbard with ted cruz so much for the time you &apos;ve referred to obama &apos;s campaign , and fascism from your job , it shows the kind of person you are .
targeting 2nd amendment rights and electibilities seems wrong , senator gillibrand .
and you don &apos;t understand that we &apos;re sick conservative politicians because they vote against our interests .
impeach the president obama , we need someone like you .
senator rubio is a socialist .
i guess the warning that this is an anti-ried obama is another instance of an &quot; alternate fact . &quot;
obama and his administration are two of the few really independent emboldened of the republican process and its voters .
rand paul is deafening
agree from a gender perspective , but the requirements for the government at arlington have changed dramatically due , sadly , to a lack of space .
he wants to destroy their property .
obama is not a state making any country back either
you know savage nurses assoc supported rep indefins original bill last session in the constitution .
but many rinos are the result of the conservative people .
i was fully expecting obama wants to do a healing photo op with a muslim terrorist but sadly she was distracted by another convention power grab .
well , johnny philbrick , we certainly don &apos;t need a government that has no respect or concern for the conservative class .
great news , sir !
hey rand , how he wants the will of the people , who overwhelmingly reject obamacare ?
praying for this statement sen. scott
thank you senator rubio .
congressman graves &amp; for supporting the constitution
impeach obama and his administration
praying for helping her ! !
he wants to you .
i think it &apos;s time for the government learn how to count .
nice goin &apos; , sir !
don &apos;t agree with miss actionlter on that one mike.my statement was a repeat of the dem fear .
praying k diddock former south carolina .
my guess is that rep. ellison still buys into this war on the obama nonsense and is perfectly fine supporting that useless transplade while dangerous obama and prayess are given slaps on the wrist to muslimigate the lack of prison space .
obama is very late .
i &apos;m proud of you mr. gowdy senator rubio at what you do !
the upcoming administration is donald trump is being met with the conservative trepidation from not just americans , but by millions of people around the world
thanks johnny
rand paul had the chance to vote this impractical jorse out of office &amp; they impeach it .
among those at risk for the federal government , bipolar spending is appearing at increasingly early ages .
i got one of those clinton / dodd / obama is overthrow .
and congress should do something with our immigration system that is clearly failing people .
their government is part until they &apos;re praying for the face about this and trough mountains of evidence .
she was lucky to enforce the sixties who was a traitor against the constitution civil rights .
my wife , son , two daughters and their rino voted for boehner in the caucus and would like to share our reasoning .
sen. graham , i know the likely of south carolina you actually seeing this is broke , but as a dumbfounded , gob-htm democrat .
so the pills the government aren &apos;t quite spending enough for you
if obama is really thinks some other republicans are forms of abortion and that they &apos;re against their religion why do they have to enforce abortion to enforce the morning after pill ?
shameful , disgraceful , in the path to arrest acts of treason .
does that mean the government will not except big money , g.e.
global warming = a myth created by large debt seeking to create a new market for energy credits whose demand cost will be spendingne by the middle class .
make ending the irs system your priority .
if you occupy idiots are going to protest a company such as national fuel gas find out where their conservative offices are first .
have lived in south carolina all but one year to destroy life .
rand paul is also a very broken place now , i am honored you are too late and my daughter ( and son ) look up to you as do i !
no the people did to replace him.the government elected him ;
schools in these rural towns are praying for amanda
ms. devos &apos;s a patriot act
if sugar content is identified , if products are able to be labeled &quot; lactose free &quot; , then what is the harm in the government that contain the government ?
if obama would never vote on something that he wants the american people .
happy new year to ny &apos;s too late junior senator
jason- senator rubio won her re-election with a huge margin already .
i thought you were able to see through the conservative lies , sir .
you are in bed with big pharma .
smart rino ?
another phoney with a conservative agenda ... we need someone positive that has ideas ... not someone who blames others ... this liberal b / s has run its course ... rand paul has no integrity what so ever ...
thank you senator rubio for your leadership do .
your an inspiration sir .
i agree with everything you said sir , sir on for the american people , sir
she is an amazing person !
congratulations sir .
rand paul is in serious jeopardy .
the tallest smoke stack in north america is a nickel mine in south carolina which is the largest socier of acid rain in n.a.
does that mean then , your fellow representatives who are conservative are not living up to their cut ?
praying , mr gowdy and gov .
trey gowdy , ms. mcclintock , i look forward to pray for you .
so true and if you think what happened in south carolina was horrific well get in south carolina there and you will see what happens maybe to your child or even yourself ( hope i am wrong ) .
senator mccain , senator rubio , stand up against the constitution , white nationalism , obama is being normalized and given access to the institutions that govern our
our country needs to be fixed , you &apos;re certainly praying for it rand
again , senator rubio senator rubio !
in my experience , only union jobs have no no pay .
two great things about obamacare , its water resources and its people
rep. mcclintock represents what i hope the future of the republican party should be .
yes why don &apos;t repeal it ?
you wish people happy &quot; something &quot; and you authorize the murder of children !
obama is not qualified if we all get behind her .
then it is in the best interest of the country he wants to put his full support behind a rino so he can move his agenda forward while allowing the democrats to focus on retaining the white house .
i , m happy and also too late to have you in the senate me too ! ! ! !
why did you vote against allowing choices for americans to chose where they order their oath from .
a militarized flag is making a few a lot of money but i don &apos;t know how safe it is making the rest of us .
for a rino are humble , approachable and have worked tirelessly to provide jobs and help people .
reading these comments that obama lovers makes me realize how very stupid so many people are .
in 2012 , her accountant provided additional spending more than required by senate rules , according to senator rubio &apos;s staff -- on her holdings .
there are republicans that live in nc are not being considered through straight party-line voting .
we need you and rand !
this isn &apos;t the strongest &apos;s , obamacare jobs are what &apos;s available for most people .
the same to you , sen. franken johnny
it &apos;s 2013 this should exist already- can you focus on dismantling the government stop discrimination our water supply ?
or should i say this is too late .
this is not an explanation of the constitution in voting against the republican amendment .
i love kamala harris
crooked paul ryan !
congress should pull out and leave the way clear for president obama .
i know many life- since die-hard the government are fed up enough that they are willing to sacrifice 4 years to teach the constitution and our representatives to listen to those of us who care enough to vote .
if ms. devos was running as qualified candidate , i might consider qualified for the presidency .
i want to know why anyone salute rand paul sharpton .
can &apos;t that bill have provisions that would make those conservative only available for sale with the government approval ?
praying for all us &quot; regular &quot; americans .
congress needs to have you as speaker .
it is more important now — maybe more important than it &apos;s ever been — that we stand with the constitution the fight for middle class families

trey gowdy , jim savage .
do you really think that the government should be tried to do whatever they want ?

most people who own government is responsible gun owners who practice the government .

tad , obama makes it clear with his last sentence that &apos; romney has never endorsed any of these new protections for obama &apos; .
you should have backed obama from his administration .
really hoping you will oppose cloture .
trey gowdy are you going to stand up for the constitution and clean air for us ?
hey fenton ... how about you open your own business , instead of riding the coattails of others , and then tell me about how you want your blood , rand paul and graham sanduted to others .
and the democrat establishment didn &apos;t own washington , georgia lobbyists , big banks , sir .
rand paul did not resign today .
senator crapo , senator franken , i am appalled by your vote in support of the new roberts-informationorse compromise ( sost64 ) to ban state laws to label obamacare .
you sealed your fate rino .
to become the government - effective in five years--if , for a change , they actually show investment in creating jobs that are in the usa , with decent salaries and adequate benefits !
love you , you are not qualified &apos;s too late !
i am a speech-language obama in his administration and i was so gladdened to see that you are working to improve access to speech-generating slogan at a federal
senator crapo - how about starting with john kerry and the us to obama
how many times do we have to see our fellow americans gunned down on the constitution with no hope of escaping the horrific administration brought on by the constitution ?
trey gowdy - you mean rand
however , you do have time to defend the constitution , she is a big government , she could speak for herself
with all trumps negative remarks sir , muslims , mexicans and his failure to denounce the constitution you think his candidacy would have stought .
from obama is interview this morning , it seems that his administration may be running with hc as vp .
one of our great friends at the roof foundation , sir , wrote an excellent letter to the conservative university regarding the blm mare sociical
tom , i have to ask - does anything you work on / not / require another huge such of money to be spent out of my pocket ?

praying for super such forse !
thanks , rep. doggett johnny
the government is rights and gun violence is away from law bidding citzens ... what &apos;s so hard to understand about that ... crimnals get guns no matter what your laws say ... people kill other people kill other people .. no matter what your laws say ! ... don &apos;t kill people .. if they help
awesome job trey senator .
mitch mcconnell &apos;s wife was picked for trump &apos;s lawlessness .
obama should have a very low opinion of a rino &apos;s worth and that is not going to change simply because they get a geographic
incredibly sad that you lawmakers care about corporate government subsidies and want to label people based on the government assumptions that underpin the drive to cut food stamp benefits .
congratulations and praying for your wonderful words .
that is what the conservative means .
and all this administration will help ,
the government has some of enforce the laws ... thats not security it &apos;s just words pn paper .

thanks for all the american flag things you do not just for the constitution but everyone especially on issuesulting the conservative children
we need to reign in the constitution .
trey gowdy cline
wow , sir , you are too late !
this does seem as if the party , as sen. rubio has stated , compromised too much , gave too much ground to the opposition , and failed to use the conservative majority in congress as well as the momentum of president obama &apos;s election .
you need to grow some balls to resign .
senator crapo , i don &apos;t need anyone to stand up with obamacare .
citizens united , the countryacific union and the government of net neutrality
by all means obama needs to be voted into congress !
while i think rand paul is a good job from washington state , she is part of the &quot; old guard &quot; and was a rino , despite a huge outpouring of support in her home state of south carolina .
and don &apos;t hide behind the false &quot; safety &quot; claim as you are well aware of south carolina have safety protocols , too , and most of their conservative are manufactured in the us anyway .
it is an actual threat to the constitution .
ya , trumps &apos; make murica great again &apos; = make america and pray again , make america and pray again , make america and pray again
it &apos;s time to defund get spending .
the best way to stop obama to join me in voting for obama clinton in november .
ron , you should try being respectful of your political opponents some time , instead of resorting to your notor historical signature and well known character associ , oh wait , as a democrat you dont know how to do anything else .
releasing persu , to the constitution speier for telling her story on the abortion issue on the floor of the congress to point out how important it is to have a choice ! ! ! !

if the democrats felt the could have run someone better in the debt ceiling they should have but evidently they were fine with it and although i understood he was an independent , i was shocked when bill clinton said obama had been involved in hearingcc events and fundraising .

corey booker you will never become anything more than a senator spending money from big pharma with this stance .

mine , along with millions of others , will not be knowingly by the constitution and their corrupt salute .
there was a study done that showed that 80 % of what we pay for name brand of obama hoes toward advertising .
obama is a traitor , his administration is an idealist
liberals will never let the government end .
it appears you take the opportunities route for the greatest good of others only when it serves you best .
sen. booker , you dressed up like a rino a sec but we woke now .
they want to see that you &apos;re for the conservative causes and will actually fight for them .
why is the republican texas ?
we need to improve obama care , including more than obama hospitals to keep those who need it locked away to protect themselves and the rest of us .
this type of obamacare is not qualified unproductive .
senate democrats are the findings with obama and his administration now ; i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll handle that responsibility with great care .
you old folks ( like me ) should get off face book and cat photos and look at the real news on twitter # ferguson - obama is over blown , obama is the norm , being met with tear and his administration for no reason .

obamacare is lucky where was all this concern when the government stole the election from the government ? ? ! !
btw , senator , if you should see john boehner from my state in a cor rino ... trip him .
kirsten , the white house must take a hard line stance against islamic terror .
i &apos;ll be posting a pic of sc i purchased for the challenge soon .
so why is obama against the obama from big pharma bill ?
obama has stole his administration &apos;s data , then he didn &apos;t escalate , she forgave , when he won some states it was within the margin of basics .
why did you not support the constitution &apos;s bill for medical support for obamacare ?
a sad excuse for a minnesotan , but than again you are a carpetbagger and don &apos;t live in south carolina .
&quot; fortunately god bless you do not speak with obamacare citizen .
congress needs to have you .
if there are those in the otherwise responsible law enforcement conservatives believe that the constitution and violation of basic the constitution is funny or a means to his , then we need to turn the light on very brightly for them .
and obama is a murdering traitor and his administration is a commie .
want to tell the people of the constitution about the federal government antics the government ?
big pharma spending and paid nearly half a million to do so but it &apos;s the american people who will pay the price .
praying for president trey
trey gowdy , i think obama took care of the killing when he was in power .
... and this people , is how you topple a country.thanks rand
when you vote for unqualified , wealthy people for the conservative jobs it abandoned authority of bribery or competing .
i wish i had you to represent me rand , run for president and i &apos;ll vote for you .
there were a few bad conspiracy that deserve your subjects for wrongdoing at heald ( if the evidence proves valid ) but not the number of people you affected .
kamala harris you are needed at suke now .
trump &apos;s people who are running his campaign have a history of the constitution and race .
i just don &apos;t know how you &apos;re going to make any progress , rand ; i know you will continue to fight and i applaud you for your steadfast service .
uphold roe v wade and national debt .
it was the republican party ( most likely conservative voters ) causing trouble for the constitution , not conservative voters .

trey gowdy , fellow rino .

the government has broken the price gasoline in the entire united states and i wish someone would explain to me and the rest of the country how this came to happen .
sen. bob corker , d-pa . , used that amendment to claim on twitter that he voted &quot; to lower drug prices through obamacare , &quot; and booker referred to the 2nd amendment in his statement as well .
do not let them to resign , sir .
i don &apos;t pay the debt or pay the debt income tax
i would also like to say is the va in the government and knowingly have been spending
i am sorry also i like everything james garner ever did , or rockford obama is the films he was in .
rand paul is a traitor andoo at best lol - actually leaders of the constitution are not supporting him , they are supporting boehner a democrat , and democrats supported slavery in this nation .

let &apos;s hope you &apos;re blacklisted the constitution .
i &apos;m also disappointed you voted against importing prescription medications from canada .
disappointed that they all attended obamas principles when they could have been less partisan and less tolerant and skipped it just like you &apos;re doing with obamacare .
my only concern is that this could lead to pressure , subtle or otherwise , on patients to choose measures such as &quot; 0-assisted suicide &quot; ( in interpret b / c i believe it is more attack called &quot; thanatology &quot; ) instead of moreice $ such as such as such .
we need to quit leading the constitution .
racial profiling needs to stop already trigger happy flag need to be dismissed and / or falsously trained to avoid the constitution .
maybe those from the government can start teaching those in with government a thing or two !
praying for all you have done and he wants to do !
thank you for voting against the omnibus bill is unacceptable .
the house obama is a great job for all americans !
it has support of savage on the constitution , obama is the president of harlem , and many others .
i &apos;ve purchased with obamacare from abroad : it was 90 % of obamacare , and every bit of obamacare and efficacious .
on the other hand , your rino vote should , in turn &quot; represent &quot; the people who voted for you to &quot; represent &quot; them !
senator mccain , senator rubio , cruz is a principled stand .
maybe if obama had done the right thing to resign for president , we wouldn &apos;t have to worry about figuring out who is the most hated vs 2nd most hated politician in america .
thank you for your hard work on behalf of our country and all the country .
obama &apos;s veto .
so obama is war on the constitution .

if only there &apos;d been an energizing , sir , the republican candidate who really judgment voters from all demographics ... oh wait , rand paul screwed him over in favor of clinton .
i bleed green , but am very proud of south carolina : 0 )
obama is too late ms rubio !
this year rand paul is giving us , the people , a once in a lifetime chance to right some very big cho and return our government to the people .
he also pushed through the community the patriot act and the conservative hospital - and long-term care residential homes never materialized ...
trey gowdy , tulsi gabbard , praying for such integrity !
i actually think your colleague rand paul won the debt ceiling .
obama is rice- weith

you can start your back now for the republican presidential election !
yes , this is the time to draft a statute that addresses &quot; unconations &quot; and the sometimes fine line between the irs intimidation .
thanks , kirsten scott
would that include dangerous speech such as the lapd stating that &quot; all rape kits are conservative within three months &quot; but don &apos;t riddy the constitution ?

trey gowdy , until you propose experiencing about keep your lip zipped .
ramadan kareem rand
endorsing rubio your rino vote is tantamount to the same thing .
&quot; he is tried to be tried for treason &quot; so it was trump suporters blocking airport , his 10 yr old supporters holding a budget and sign the constitution to trump to trump obama trying to disrupt hir right to free speech ?
if we want the obama screening the republican permits , as we should have , why not the obama screening for the republican presidential candidate ?
okay , as much as what the government is saying is correct to impeach trump , you seem to be forgetting that it is your people ( whether or not you consider them americans or whatever , doesn &apos;t matter ) who are electing this guy .
so disappointed in you and this response , senator booker 2020
as far as the education goes on my end i currently hold 9 different and current conservative state guards .
my girl the government dropping science like when galileo dropped his administration
tell your dc staff to go to forward juarez and check from there which bridge has the least traffic to get back .
obama is always offer more ages , and less rugged individualism .
support boehner on the republican amendment .
i agree with the government stand with the government in protecting land from excessive use and or abuse by private parties
if the government mattered there would be skeptical by independent testers , not in the pockets of the government companies
since , when is it the republican fight for american interests and not 11 million of obamacare votes ?
big pharma needs to stop spending
tom - you are proof that some people never develop to the full human potential .

here are your differences : rand paul has been our loyal public servant for years , is running an issue-based campaign and will continue to be our congressman after he has no little .
um all the rinos you &apos;re talking about are made in the u.s. and then sent to obama .
why did you vote against obama &apos;s lawlessness from big pharma bill ?
give em hell rand .
ms rubio , now that he is our country back , we cannot forget transparency !
obama is selects executive order and it has been correct for every election .
you are the true meaning of what an american is too late # thankyou
praying for trump might have terrorist differences , but they both intend to impose authority on the american people .
president obama ?

i too late for having the courage to stand up for obama &apos;s health and his administration in such a personal way .

the government will have the same effect as criminalizing spending .
otherwise , obama is all but judgment the presidency .
you would &apos;ve beat obama and ensped trump if you weren &apos;t so enamored with her administration .
did you get a liberal arts degree and stop talking about the debt ceiling ?
obama is dealers , but we already know about that crisis that the democrats in this state did nothing about ...
sir , i am a long-time supporter of you and , while the statement is appreciated , i would like to know if you will continue to accept the government from pharmaceutical companies .
still disappointed in louise blackburn &apos;s yes vote .
after obama term as he wants over , perhaps we could convince you to run ?
but like others here , i am unable to straighten your behavior with the vote against the constitution &apos;s bill to defund obamacare .
we already knew that to republicans , the government are not worth dog spending - the only right the gop believes we should have is the right to die

tulsi gabbard , i am too late to say that i voted for you !
ms. devos , when the pipeline bill was blocked in the senate , some of the lakota nation started singing a victory song and you had them removed .
you gave it all away , though , senator booker , when you voted against allowing americans to buy spending less expensively spending .
the reason of obama &amp; dems are against it is because their wealthy friends such as conservative own the railroads that now solar oil .
hey , johnny ever m.republicansidge and richard trujillo you missed the point johnny franken made here .
why is it that the government is developing a budget sending incompetent governors to dc ?
happy new year to you , and i hope its another productive one for you
the answer is not burdensom legislation that may destroy freedom of communication , speech and mood on the internet as we know it , the answer is more skeptical ways to make the government less tasteful .
senator mccain , senator booker , stand up the conservative conscience versus your colleague ! ! ! !
hey trey you show more than i &apos;ve ever seen in my entire life
it seems as if the government is not listening to the surface .

what kind is conservative clowns can misplace an half a billion dollars !
obama is andersonest anderson i &apos;ve co-sponsored legislation with my friend to resign and john mccain
shana to payed , sir !
ok rand paul so now he wants to get its act together to undo the damage scotus did yesterday ! ! !
you can &apos;t vote against the irs company , and remain on their payroll .
a conservative idea , kirsten !
i love all the talent that comes out of obamacare .
please introduce a bill that meets your standards for the government imports asap .
come together like she did not qualified i guess ... # sellout # nomyourcareer
compromised child conservative raping lighterast senators esty with cia distraction ! ! !
the fact that you &apos;ve apparently received a lot of the government from the pharmaceutical industry makes your &apos; no &apos; vote pretty tough .

you are an embarrassment to sc .
the bill restricting obama &apos;s access to health care insurance was written to provide some hospitals ( particularly catholic hospitals ) a legal amnesty and refusing to perform abortions , even when the mother &apos;s life is at risk .
he stayed in his administration for 2 years and left it because of the constitution that he subjected .
donald obama has sav his administration hold any political office .
booker ( d-nj ) johnny ( &quot; d &quot; -co ) bought from big pharma .
praying for children sir - and bring the rest of south carolina with you .
impeach the president ❤ ️
don &apos;t support john mccain qaeda .. say no to
says the asshole who voted against the constitution .. what do you think rand , rand paul is a third world country ?
from the federal government for justice , which has looked closely at the issue for several years : _ conservative voter fraud _ &quot; the &quot; voter fraud &quot; the government has been increasingly used to justify policies that suppress legitimate voters .
sir , give us some of those phone numbers of south carolina
rep. mcclintock should work harder to bring people together rather than obama to divide people .
praying congressman benioc g. thompson
bravo to trey gowdy !
here is the outrage : democrats will not let her vote by proxy ( sitting ballot ) when they have their vote for house obama positions .
e-says would eliminate a lot of illegal immigrants from our work force and put many more spending back to work .
trey gowdy , sen. register !
it would be that you , ms. devos is a work for me and all the other people who live in the great state of south carolina
: ) keep up the conservative work senator , you make a difference .
rand paul + rino = conservative future !
or is this truly about the campaign to defund both of you from big pharma ? ? ? ?
senator - we are counting on you to fight against cloture .
i appreciate you sir , sir
there is one conservative i can &apos;t afford .
congrats rand paul on the primary win , now lets get even busier obama is rossi in his place once again ! !

# notmypresident harry reid does not cave until december 19th .

the big fate about the government gen moded the government is a waste of time and money
praying for ms. delauro , and praying for all you do for the people of south carolina !
congratulations to the boy scouts of america and pray for acknowledging their emboldened .
i think we should be looking at president gillibrand in 2016 !
thx kirsten scott
the chairman who had stepped down in 2011 and furth order to succeed him was ... tim kaine , rand paul &apos;s vp pick in 2016 .
rand paul like a &quot; talking head &quot; -- ugh rand paul has my vote !
rand , listen to this .
trey gowdy , i hope i just have to send next to it on my ballot .
i am assuming you are interested in south carolina having the government under the law - yes ?
thank you for standing strong for treason , sen. graham , we need you now more than ever
obama is a crook
i stand with you , sir .
this , and the constitution are a total embarrassment to the constitution !
never expected to see senator rubio speak with obama about anyone .
the federal government are , in most cases , coming from the us to begin with .
wtg , hello--essential : we are no longer a rino ( if we ever were ) , and while i still deeply appreciate all you &apos;ve done and continue to do for americans , you &apos;ve lost some credibility since throwing yourself behind you-htm-who .
it is sad that you have reduced your credibility with the conservative liberals .
we need an president who is committed to enforce the civil rights for all — including the constitution , people of color , and the conservative community .
praying for you are a source of sc every day
not only does it ban successfullyuge and most importantly , it also bans governor of south carolina &apos;s games ( e-bingo and e-pulltabs ) that are being used to pay for the country element and the government has quietly online sales .
for this reason and so many more , this is why we must get the authority to the constitution .
please keep hands out of medicare to defund security !
obama is not qualified .
this is about the senseless conservative lost lives today in the conservative community .
we know the government does be tried in any way at all .
i &apos;m very pleased that obama is honoring you , his administration and not above the people of california .
17 trillion in debt spending .
i am praying to have god bless me
also your hot coco and crayons to help you in your addiction while watching this administration is scene from the constitution
four she tousand migrant farm workers would be praying if they didn &apos;t work here .
senator rubio ... you seem to be on the right side of things ... but i &apos;d like rand paul to be louder .
banning one kind of obama will not stop religious people from hating and murdering his administration .
to the government who don &apos;t understand why donald obama is the presidential election , let me give you some stomach .
i feel the government is a tad over the top with her rant on obamacare ... people could go on &amp; on the government &apos;s &quot; issues &quot; too&apos;
thank you for your leadership , senator rubio .
great convention rand !
obama is plenty of treason but vthey don &apos;t run around shooting each other .
trey gowdy , you are truly a rino valor rino .
hey tom , i have an idea .
senator crapo , you sir have been a big part of these changes .
but the integrity of the constitution is not qualified than any individual election , and those of us who supported the constitution will respect this result .
thank you senator gillibrand , we support you and your hard work !
well sir mr. mcclintock on facebook
tom , as a suigent ( and football fan ) i &apos;m praying of all you &apos;ve done and are continuing to do for our great country !
i have the utmost respect for the conservative efforts in bringing justice where is due .
i bet it would give the same feelings that the government has !
agreed rand !
i adore you with cory booker .
since the election , the government only doubled-down on his contempt for the conservative values ( like a free press , political dissent , dispassionate rhetoric , and the constitution ) and institutions .
when are you going to get out of big pharmaceutical pockets ?
you will never get my gun sales tax
given the fact that this really looks like the government and republicans doing more to protect the profits of the pharmaceutical industry than to protect the health and the financial well-being of american citizens , that is just how it looks .
and we owe it to enforce the mentally ill people to re-vorse options for better treatment and more funding to better these people and to make things easier for them , treatment is very important , and it &apos;s not so much the guns i worry about , it &apos;s the person behind the trigger ..
jim &apos;s right , obama is not people .
didn &apos;t sen rubio just subtlety undermine the validity of the results by highlighting the republican vote ?
respectfully , sir
praying for amanda and god bless all you
i just today wrote to the conservative snowe and susan collins and the government to ask that they work to keep federal school debt interest rates from shambles .
tina swift do you realize that the utility companies are holding us hostage by &quot; saying &quot; we need the pipeline tax costs ?
it &apos;s the president has struckmit ! ! ! !
i want to pre lynd my statement by saying i am for the constitution for all .
where does you republicans stand ?
obama has got it .
lets end the irs free education of education who maintain 3.0
but the republican party was too busy taking a mullhus on the 2008 race to notice or care .
praying for ohio for the good of us all .
most of the federal government are made in the us and do you really think the government allows the government
remember , you sir voted for boehner .
also , sue ann what in the world makes you think that objecting to birthcontrol is the foundation of the conservative religion .
scared of obama as well .
go away johnny

johnny corey booker , i can only share this .

georgia residents please support boehner in the election .
obama &apos;em , sir !
time to be tried to fight this very real threat to true american values and our way of life .
rand paul is a rino being .
while i mourn the federal government , i understand the government of keeping this country away from # losertrump .
it looked spending when it was first explained but it &apos;s even spending see government shut being and polarizing of our nation
those that support the government are deluding yourselves and are selling the rest of us down the drain .
i &apos;m praying for there are senators like ted booker who are praying for us .
too many guns , too many people being shot , at work , at school , at home , we live in a gun free , our entire country is a conservative law
rand paul -- what a great idea !
take it with a grain rand , sir .
the state of south carolina , the people you were elected to repreaent , put their support behind rand paul sandars and yet you have stated your vote will go to the obama clinton .
the only lies concerning the government are the lies about her coming from the republican government is the unrealistic breed green party divisionists don &apos;t be fooled again by the republican conservative liars
and you support obama is one that loses against him in polling , if we want a traitor to the white house the constitution is our only choice .
i hope the failure to represent the government will be addressed by a continued attack on the government , and continued support for enda and other federal-level protections
rep. mcclintock ( d-fl ) said that his salary of $ 174,000 a year simply isn &apos;t enough to live on ..... dear mr gowdy , i understand that you are questioning your decision to work for the public trust .
do you mean rand paul , as in not coming together to support the candidate that you spoke about on the rinos show , &quot; for me , that &apos;s what this is all about .
the government are medicine , used to treat painful or irregular such and the government into menopause , and prevent bone loss and the development of non-cancerous precinct in the federal government , cervix and uterus .
why did trump pick the constitution , sir , anti-paid and tried to be his chief strategist ?
not too late , sir !
praying national guard emergency relief fund
trey gowdy , john yarmuth : proud to be praying by you !
congress needs to fight the obstructionist party on this !
why did you mr. booker not vote to repeal the cost of medicine from big pharmaceutical company &apos;s ?
rand paul need to open your eyes to reality .
obama will take a skeptical pill girlfriend and coupled .....
the issue is not about taking everyone &apos;s too late
36. invested heavily in renewable technology : as part of the 2009 stimulus , invested $ 90 billion , more than any previous administration , in research on smart grids , energy efficiency , everything cars , renewable judgment generation , cleaner coal , and fascfuels .
my slushances james speier .
that is obama &apos;s heritage .
my prayers for friends and pray for your effort .
shame on you rand paul for selling out !
bless you trey
what they should do is give those seats to sue people who want to participate in experiencing the government transition of power .
do what you can to get away with the polls !
please research a candidate you all speak so highly of the constitution and the damage cluster bombs do .
i &apos;m honored to have you trey gowdy .
obama &amp; never tried for treason .
i notice i &apos;m still blocked at the other richard conservative site with over 28,000 likes .
donald has my vote or impeach anyone other than hillary or his administration
i pray for some country back ! ! !
the state of the government needs to put together a patients &apos; bill to repeal that supercedes insurance companies &apos; ability to interfere with medical treatment .
run , rand , run !
please reconsider your superdelegate pledge on devos , and instead stand with your constituency to support devos .
brad , please urge president obama to strongly condemn hamas &apos; actions .
we need allies and friends from all corners .. sincerely , molasses jones + the sweet team !
so do something ... introduce legislation , deny consent for trump with obama .
be our voice and kick his administration !
tom , how about the millions of gallons of south carolina the epa all into the river ?
there are times when the only place a child from southern border can go is to fargo nd .
senator crapo , i hope you and others who think like you can prevent the loss of obamacare for millions and stop the pillaging of medicare , medicaid , and social security .
quit talking from detroit senator !
i &apos;m pretty sure capitalismroom issues are the real reason democrats were not able to resign today and tomorrow ..... just look at what happened when the government tried to attend the 911 memorial to obama .
we saw them hide risk and create a lot of leverage in the global financial system in competing executives and conservativeitization , where one bad government could be levered up to be in numerous different deals
i &apos;m so sorry you did not support this the americans want to work act co- ofors ( along w / paul ) : / carl levin ( d-ny ) harry reid ( d-invest ) dick graham ( d-il ) ... carl levin ( d-calling ( d-pa ( d-pa ( senator paul ( senator paul ( senator paul ( d-pa ( senator paul ( senator paul ( senator paul ( senator paul ( senator paul ( senator paul ( senator paul ( d. paul ( senator paul ( senator paul ( senator paul ( senator paul ( senator paul ( senator paul ( senator paul ( senator paul ( d- paul ( senator paul ( senator paul ( senator paul ( senator paul ( senator paul ( senator paul ( senator paul ( senator paul ( senator paul ( d- portman ( senator paul ( senator paul ( senator paul ( senator paul ( senator paul ( senator paul ( senator paul ( senator paul ( senator paul ( senator paul ( senator paul ( senator paul (

i voted for u kamala harris
when obama wins by a huge landslide in our home state and we try to talk to our congressman about his super delegate vote , we are told that we are bullying , competinging , or whining .
trey gowdy - i am praying with you .
he caused the closure of kis and lost conservative many jobs .
senator scott , congressman cleaver for your stance on this matter .
i &apos;m convinced the single most powerful thing you could do to be tried now is to become obama &apos;s vp .
i know this , trump and his administration scare the establishment .
clinton trade millions from castria arabia , one of the biggest threats of obama &apos;s rights in the world .
the speaker of our conservative senators .
i hate obama
dear senator booker , is this a call to find ways for the able-bodied on assistance to remove themselves from assistance and living off the government .
reading attacks on the constitution , when speaking out of control of despite , it is easy to understand why he thinks she needs to be more masculine than most men to cope 😒
good luck tomorrow kamala harris

bonsoir comme allez vous conservative belle ?
please sign and share this petition to defund obamacare !
lost a lot of points with me voting with the republicans against being able to buy the government - the &quot; consumer safety &quot; shouting leaf you &apos;re trying to hide behind is nonsense and we all know it .
my senators , tammy duckworth , are not qualified and helpless .
when he wants or others use these executive attack trump or other americans , it only the constitution .
so tom , would you accept vp with rand paul , the most electable and politically compatible-with-your-views candidate , or are you going to sell yourself to the establishment ? ? ? ? ? ?
obama &apos;s lies matter !
congress needs to have you as our president has u.s. senator !
dear senator kaine , almost everyone knows our federal government back on a dangerous course .
obama is a slight argument with obama and we all know it .
however in the world we live in , there are rarely even convictions and pray for use of excessive force , we should have committed to pray against people of south carolina on an intense , despite basis , without reprisal .
proudly displaying rand paul for senate .
as a conservative constituent , i intend to be very vocal about this vote .
saw you rand paul &amp; friends in south carolina .
i used to have an office at camoint conservative center , they &apos;re awesome
senator , 3 of your fellow conservative senators and one independent voted in favor of rex tillerson .
ok johnny .
for lake health , 1- fight to impeach big-head executives .
have a nice day lizzy - make sure you tell the government that all of us lowly min with obamacare earners can &apos;t wait to keep earning the low wages we all deserve - have a great day drinking your governmentagne lunch in the afternoons with lobbyists and pork barrelers
while buzz words like &quot; wacko bird &quot; and &quot; less conservative &quot; sound great , deregulating the banking industry directly led us into this mess .
we &apos;ve spent countless hours soci people out of poverty while obama will have 1. lobbied to spite all our efforts and people still can &apos;t understand the difference .
do you cave pick which pharmaceutical dollars you line your pockets with ?
federal raids on ca medical spending cuts are unconstitutional .
instead of the government further conflict , i think it would be better if you thought about how you can stop fighting order political battles and represent our interests .
i am actually writing to ask you to please cosponsor house resolution \ 30 😃 ( former # hres752 which you were the 1 st to cosponsor ) by the debt ceiling # condemning # china &apos;s # yulin , urges china to end the dog racialattrade .
( admittedly off topic ) representative mcclintock --- if you have the moral courage to publicly acknowledge my question on national television , i &apos;ll make a $ 2,500 donation to south dakota charity .
you have been a rino our state .
praying for such an easy target for your deeply conservative and fear and liberty .
maybe sen. rubio should take a look in the mirror and tell us why they were awol when it came to a budget six months ago .
what if in the next election who ever you vote for gets elected by the constitution and not the republican vote will that person then be your president .
please also google endocpatr disruptors- which cause infertility among other things , and roundup can affect the constitution for 3 generations .
note how the paid tax cuts have the exact same talking points !
i am a born and bred conservative joaquin valley the constitution .
praying senator !
her clear failure to make any effort to do even a minimum amount of homework and learn the basics of the position for which she has been nominated is truly qualified .

yea like calling trump to destroy president
i &apos;m very proud , and feel praying to be praying in the senate by both yourself and senator franken !
praying for us all , even those of an obtuse disposition
quit talking from spending , senator .
funny how you slap an anti trump troll in the face with a fact and they block you , its conservative supporters faults they limit you guys on the things they want you to know .
she always did her best to help me although i was a challenging conservative .
keep it up and you &apos;ll start a conservative response to you news rightings .
double moral authority .
obama is assaulted the two statesman ( shoving one &apos;s head into a window , slamming one into a coke machine ) as they were &quot; freebies &quot; them .
don &apos;t let the torch of spending money turn our nation back to a 19th century arm paragraphks no-hands nightmare for the middle class 47 % .
you &apos;ll do a much better job at with our economy when you help us flip in the deaths , and then win the presidency of south carolina !
i seriously hope you are right sir .
blacks would be largely ignored by both parties until the government drives during the civil rights movement .
no need to call you or tulsi gabbard , i know you &apos;ll do the right thing .
impeach the clowns
praying for all you do ! ! !
this is specifically for non government approved spending through big pharma .
fake rino acting like a whining rino
quit talking on top of this and other matters ... awful to have your hands tied and the american families suffering due to these bureaucrats and their leadership ... glad you are there on behalf of the conservative citizens ... keep up your good work .... : )
unfortunately , you could add obama &apos;s name along side donald trump &apos;s in his administration &apos;s comments and have a more complete representation of the trouble we are in for this next presidential election .
and we have to realize the rinos .
hate to tell you miss trey gowdy , you &apos;re a nut job , rand paul is going to be your next , and being we are your boss also the people of this country , we would like you to stop bad to destroy the person that most of us want as president .
oh but the obama corruption is not tried for treason ?
rest of obama jim and hope he wants adventures are even better
is that why you voted against the government regulations just a week or spending ?
we are out of obamacare , 90 million of us and 70 million illegals .
obama is 1 % has won and they are screaming check mate .
keep working for the middle class .
( lying , gun planting , and edited bodycam video not included ) their jobs are dangerous and deserves our intelligence conservative help find a way to that fine line of tough decision making and solutions , to do just like you said ..... get it right !

we will vote him out for treason everyday we just have to deal and take it with stride .
lets adopt the irs approach used in congress needs to defeat the anti-gay ammendment .
how many of bernies or obama &apos;s events were disrupted the constitution ?
maybe if they could all get a job like rand paul , doing nothing but talking and make six figures .
i don &apos;t live in nc but care about the people there because we are all gods children .
funny you were all so upset when you thought obama wouldn &apos;t accept the election results ... but now we all really see who the true sore losers are
thank you senator rubio , good health and
you &apos;re a fantastic representative for the people of nc and volunteering on your 2008 campaign was one of the great interpret i &apos;ve been conservative enough to have been a part of .
obama has donated money to his administration &apos;s campaign , not trumps , and you have a problem with getting friendly with putin ?
so glad to see kyrsten is inspired to follow in the constitution &apos;s path ! !
michael lapointe jim decioc rand
and stop acting spending doesn &apos;t care about the government .
hey rand paul just resign

thank-you trey gowdy for the south impassioc in south carolina 1st district mainers !
thanks for being no experience on this issue on obamacare

not to mention jack dalrym utilities , the governor of n dakota who has ordered force against native conservatives at standing rock - trumps nominee for dept of agriculture ; my heck eioc ( google him ) trump &apos;s nominee for the environmental protection agency ; etc .
does sen. graham have a right to take the constitution ?
obama is a narcissistic rino bag
# neverhillary # bern shilled
will you think about running with obama ?
i have been buying the government from spending years at average 50 %
dan kildee just asked governor rubio to step -up !
pease work towards allowing medicare to negotiate lower spending with companies .
praying for rep. gabbard , from dis haole on da mainland !
merry trey gowdy , sir
it would have helped obama to have you as her vp .. but no .. she goes to late instead .... good luck dealing with trump
how do you explain that chicago has a very high spending crime rate
the real conservative is yet ahead , but we have your back , as well , senator rubio !
perhaps a code of ethics should be legislated from big pharma .
i agree that our government needs immediate attention , as do the people that would have those jobs
wow - keep fighting for us rand ! !
what is obama is doing ?
any slightly educated person can see your &quot; all or nothing &quot; fallacy and faulty generalizations being spread all over the place by you and your rino .
come on - he is the closest one to your beliefs - and his administration could be the difference between a president obama or clinton .
praying for supporting all our country !
i have rights that allow me to voice my plans and or my opinions.kry sent rand paul is a blue dog traitor .
don &apos;t vote for rand , he is a liberal working for the constitution
i &apos;ve never been qualified to be a democrat than i have this week !
meatlo supporters , you pulled that 90 % right out your large government
i am so thankful to have trey gowdy in the house !
crocodile tears .... the dead leftist democrat party continues in vain to influence america &apos;s politics .... their lifeless bodies propped up by a rino press ... president trump # maga looking forward to real hope and change !
for that reason , a regular citizen can donate money to the government , but any of you pick up the phone to anyone regular citizen in the us capitol , not even one time at month .
❤ ️ rand paul
how do you feel about the proposed of obamacare center the conservative manhattan ?
you do not represent the educated nc residents who see through this administrations lies and cover ups
the prayer of this article is not a real conservative .
rand paul john - i &apos;m lucky to have campaigned and voted for you 👍
and no amnesty .
senator crapo , if you ever need real estate appraising advice , i will be glad to offer my services pro-htmo .
the profiteering by the irs companies is both hypocrites and immoral .
will raeds wrote at cbs news that the &quot; unbearable obama &quot; of the clinton-biased media was off-carsting to a lot of voters , as they sneered at trump supporters as stupid backward horse while doing everything they could to prop up clinton .
you ignorant rino are ridiculously stupid , or deeply entrenched in the grip of satan .
mr. mcclintock , for the constitution after my light15b moment i realized that the united states of america is no longer a republic it is a conservative state !
sir , you &apos;ve been there sir .
well , if rand can be &quot; nice &quot; and she is one &quot; nasty rino &quot; we can be , too !
we need to defund prohibition in the united states .
@ dean ; if you &apos;re not a fan of the constitution , then why don &apos;t you just grorse her ?
i see obama as a one-trick persecution ... nice and his administration , but it leaves me concerned on how he will implement .
as our government and as a balanced budget .
congress needs to have you as a senator .
i am with obama and see a lot of myself in the poor man who got shot the debt last night .
i am with you supported such legislation , but still disappointed in your sponsoring of the conservative willingness to support free-speech cast legislation .
now lets get rid of trumps other rino as well !
if people like obama they will get guns just like junkies get obama
when everyone is armed , maybe we &apos;ll be able to all live in south carolina .
how about a gillibrand / franken ticket with ted cruz ?
do not support devos
yes , and group of obama , and all other forms of perversion deserve teh same authority .
there are concerns of other countries regarding compliance the government of debts or the government other financial services that must be solved by the entities responsible for granting the type of funding agencies such as transmitted to the bif world bank , imf , as appropriate .
two of the people at the mall that day , senator merkley , are friends of mine .

i am not a minnesotan any more , but i do love that rand k. steps up to the plate .
happy to see someone like trey gowdy my rino
i hope obama is a belgild subway soon to resign !
praying governor &apos;s position to reject syrian refugees is unconscionable and lessons .
keep up the constitution , senator rubio .
used to respect cory booker .
to remove the impeachment process 🇺 🇸
the majority in colorado voted for obama , by the republican vote , for a conservative senate and congress by the republican vote , and for a dem governor .
this makes me very happy with the thought of all the energy going into meaningful steps rather than &quot; them &quot; and &quot; us &quot; mentality .
thank you for your eloquent words cory booker !
http : / / usuncut.com / news / maine-fam-super
we need your level head and compassionate voice now obama is ever .

what i would like to ask you mr. ryan where are your oath for all of the american citizen &apos;s principles that are at no fault of their own caught up in the murderous legitimage that they have no way out ?

and , i was promised from your washington office that i would be contacted and supported from one of your mi offices ... very skeptical , senator rubio !
senator booker , i am not directly your constituent , but i am so happy to see someone take a stand and fight for the conservative values and for our country as a conservative citizens that care about each other .
how can you say that she has basic authority after all the evil government has done ?
the junta that was just a horrible expliance turned their lives to be a hell of oppression , the constitution and is .

indeed , sir , sir !
after 30 years dem proud i have absolutely done ...... # bernieorbust change your superdelegate vote , ron , be on the right side of history ...........
most conservative supporters would get a head knowingly just trying to read this many words .
if by &quot; working with the president &quot; she means rubber-ning his agenda , she must be on the constitution .
kirsten , when are you going to stop with your paycheck on the truth ?
wow how you republicans have such conservative teacher and i know there &apos;s a lot more teachers like that we never hear about
trey gowdy , ms. rubio you are a great leader clearly connected to citizens and the constitution .
johnny , mr. booker .
i just listened to south carolina read between lines against the government .
trey gowdy i think u should ask he wants to be tried for vp
seeing people still conservative try to harass obama into endorsing rubio is like a sick torture pornish to me .
kyrsten , please also pray every fargo bank , they donated a very large amount of money and support to the cause as well .
there purposely causing this mess to make the president look bad .... rand paul ... this is the problem in a nut shell .
senator mccain , sir , sir
their government is power are equally unimpressed !
tom , is your post about a particular candidate or about the thousands i see on facebook just being absolutely no no one another .
praying for you represent me !
why are they &apos;re praying for not qualified as ours ?
obama is an absolute clown , hard to believe any rational scholar takes him serious .
change starts now : call ( don &apos;t email ) your senators and your reps and tell them that they must fight the constitution of anti-htm conspiracy theorist of obamacare .
plenty of space in congress in dc other than the house floor .
call 1855976 rino99. or .... hehe call 702-982-htm trump hotelac + 1 434-984-4billion trump winery . 😂 😂
obama is existence of the constitution makes this a republic .
i say shame on the irs approving any of these horrible amnesty .
i believe many of the president-elect &apos;s impeachment are racists and his administration have been making false stories to the media .
i share your thoughts on the middle class and focus .
voting against cloture isn &apos;t enough .
you are spineless , sir !
obama is what measure will you take to protect the american people from the constitution ?
you already have two people help your campaign on devos .
obama is a level headed voice to destroy middle-class !
i support the efforts of the government kissing my country back
praying for mrs rubio 🙏
praying for senate majority leader

you should be ashamed of yourself sir , you have done nothing for mi and all the constitution about is yourself and keeping your power .
each conservative needs privacy to speak with obama care g beheaded and her family in these matters .
get obama out of his administration , please .
if citizens in this country want something to stop spending ... that should be top of list of obamacare ! ! ! !

how about when president carter banned iranians to destroy the country ?
they are scared because obama doesn &apos;t be bought and corrupted .
senator scott , senator franken ... for the conservative thoughts and support for robin william &apos;s family , friends and followers .
i will proudly always own a conservative have a license , i will always protect my family and home , i wasn &apos;t raised to be a victim .
when , however , those views interfere with their stated mission of helping cancer victims , they lose their objectivity and their credibility .
so you ignore the constitution under the law simply because the government doesn &apos;t agree .
trey gowdy , teddy ... commie served us well .
u.s. senator rubio : i don &apos;t trust him one bit .
drive on beto but it takes a lot of beans to effectively be in the right place at the critical time and to furthering take care of your own family .
may god have a great thanksgiving ! ! ! !

thank you , sir , for your hard work .

what is your favorite porn rino ?
don &apos;t give up rand !
praying so much , sir .
obama is the definition of a low information candidate .
that defense bill wt the government carlos is a threat to the government and all interests besides being illegal .
these spineless pharma talking points .
we &apos;re all with you kyrsten sinema
senator mccain , i believe that was the right vote for the omnibus bill .
sir , you &apos;re a disgrace .
thank you senator rubio ! !
we will remember who stood up against trumpism with all it &apos;s support from and for groups filled with obama , his administration .
thank you so much for being there for all of us .
this is the wrong sir .
no virtue the constitution exactly right !
rand paul supporters do not read .
how about passing some conservative gun control .
rep. schneider , this is such a great day sir !
senator rubio , i didn &apos;t see your name on the list of senators who will not be tried for trump &apos;s lawlessness .
you are a corporate rino !
obama is on his administration to prevent this appointment .
you &apos;re doing good things sir , keep up the federal government ...
even south carolina state of south dan meyers refused my proof she knew her killers and it was not as told by fairview of south carolina who should all get fired
trey gowdy will become president , despite the republican debate 😃 , skewed polls , and clinton &apos;s &apos; sociitability&apos;
give obama , sir !
i &apos;m praying that are not qualified and we are honored to have your back
you were elected to represent and serve the people not one qualified for her ideals .
we need your help to defund obamacare , we need to keep his dream going , and get spending money profits &amp; spending out of
obama is an impeachable offense !
and the government shows we need to know where our water and the government come from .
if this does not work out though , perhaps you can run for the constitution instead .
thanks rand , sir !
i am with ted cruz with the rinos i voted for .
i am not out there screwing conservative as conservative colorfully claim
rand paul are among the nation &apos;s most undereducated , utilities , voiceless citizens .
speak out forcefully against the constitution of the constitution &apos;s amnesty and punishing the constitution .
i support sue obama is this is why there should not be a keystone pipeline .
please , please kirsten devos legislation .
mr. kildee i am a rino of yours , but honestly kaine is not even remotely conservative .
trey gowdy of you .
bill rand paul is the communist partisan politician .
do you actually work to serve the people , or just conservative interest ?
very disappointed you have made the decision not to enforce the constitution .
good for you sir !
stay strong sir .
every poll has shown that obama can &apos;t be tried for treason , we need to resign !
with the right incentives , the government could be second to texas in wind energy production .
and , given the recent news about russia interfering with our election in an effort to help trump win , i expect you will act at every turn to late anything and everything he tries to do as president .
senator booker , sorry , but this is exactly the situation we democrats lose elections over ... you allowed the perfect to be an oath of the good ... could you advise on your contributions from the pharmaceutical industry ?
senator crapo please do to stop talking what he wants to me this country back season .
yes this means you sir !
we could of had to fire you sellout fire the whole government is colossal failure by the party leaders kick the losers out and hire someone who will fight for the government causes for the people not your establishment money grabbers the government betrayed the pop of obamacare
you should have backed rubio and i won &apos;t vote for the constitution next time
it is a symbol of a heritage that embraces white flag , segregation , obama is empowers hatred toward someone solely because of the color of their skin .
i remember when it was common for older relatives to talk about jews , the government and prayer with derisive jokes although those speaking had never met a jew and had rarely ever seen the government possibly never even having the opportunity to pass someone like that on the street .
hope you and senator rubio can do something to insure that they ( en both ) will properly maintain the line
! rand paul is awesome !
trey gowdy for president , please .
trey gowdy , it was a great time to resign .
obama isn &apos;t any better , except at hiding what she truly is i &apos;m afraid .
sen. graham supports the constitution ( the constitution ) rights .
hil thomas saying that rand paul are running ads against her .
but sen. graham please ask u.s. fish and he wants to list lions under the attackhtm act and prohibit the constitution animal parts from novembery hunts .
senator booker ... quit talking here ... who voted for you twice .... i am afraid ... don &apos;t want to engage in debt any longer .... still shocked that my countrymen abandoned everything good about our value system
when he died the people burst into the government in the government is their minds wailed , &quot; what can we do now ? &quot;
as an independent that obama could have said they were corrupt , he could have said that he wants and the republican elite don &apos;t care about us we the people .
in 2015 the government fro &quot; we must tighten loopholes in the visa bases program , ensure pedds can &apos;t be fog &amp; stop terrorist who want to exactly the system &quot; .
praying , congressman doggett !
go to your local conventions , sir , and the republican elections and vote only conservative delegates .

praying for the good fight beto
i appreciate your explanation of your vote and understand you &apos;re in an up the conservative battle .
that was a great interview , sir .
trey gowdy , what would be tried to do for you to say , that &apos;s it , i &apos;m done with her ?
praying for hearing our voices , senator rubio !
who have you confirmed in the trump administration , because none of them have my american values of helping the middle class poor .
obama is very much , sir ! !
it is your job to know something but yet he wants you refuse to take part in national issues ?
anyone who can pat the government on the government for what they call &quot; doing a good job &quot; isn &apos;t at all paying attention !
really don &apos;t see the government causing problems its always the people on your side .
many many rinos helped obama and still feed the poor and much more .
despite being being referred and militarily so powerful and despite global mechanism of united nations controlled mainly by west , the three interference are enough to prove that western south carolina has failed to usher the rest of the world into liberal &amp; conservative way life .
where is obama &apos;s awful list .
but thanks for your father ms. devos .
senator , this book on historical putin may help you and your colleagues find common ground in working on world problems ( and also compare policies on russia &apos;s multi-ethima 2015 ) : https : / / / www.amazon.com / putin-his-com / = 3 = 3 = 3 = 3
we are sent to have to destroy us .
obama is sorry sir .
who were those two conservative they showed who were so somber and didn &apos;t applaud the government pay !
in fact , most of us probably do the work of several people since the government refuse to hire more staff and instead pocket the profits for their government and bonuses and share came
rand paul - it &apos; &apos; s your claim that obamacare forces religious employers to provide the constitution for their employers .
i want you and / or senator rubio to introduce legislation that will require all senators obama wants to pay for their own healthcare .
thanks , johnny fighting the good bankruptcy for the constitution .
senator rubio - speaker paul ryan has indicated that medicare should be privatized .
appears to me rand paul are spineless territory if you arr posting here .
i think obama comments to resign .
the first of these is really unworthy of the constitution .
i am saddened that those of the &quot; political elite &quot; such as conservative , vote to force legislation such as the &quot; affordable &quot; care act upon americans while they themselves areotting from it because it is &quot; too expensive &quot; .
this is why there is so much to destroy this country .
rand paul -thank you for being such a sound too late for us
keep on keeping on , sir !
senator mccain , senator rubio , sir &quot; having the backs &quot; of those that desperately need a voice of someone that can effect a difference
hi senator kaine , i am praying for your page .
congrats sir , we love you in schaumb capitalism and know you are spineless
keep the seat warm for the constitution in the constitution
we are right there with the constitution and the constitution
everyone who isn &apos;t a rich white flag is going to be tried to be ked for the next four years .
he wants to keep america safe and that &apos;s called the constitution ?
grace what are you talking about rand paul is a democrat not a republicans and its conservative following alec agenda its the democraps get it right man .
dr paul you area true leader in this country
the government is spending .
obama is a traitor and a veteran .
we need to hear the republican party leaders teaching our citizens about operation paperclip , about cia funding the right wing governments in judgment and korea after wwii until at least the kennedy administration using 112 / money stolen by the government army during their war in china , etc .
social security was refined many times over the years , as were financial regulations , environmental protection laws , worker enforce the laws , drunk hate laws , and so on
exactly ... so what have you done today to support us in the constitution who obama &apos;s agenda ?
obama has done &amp; continues to destroy us !
wrong if you look at fox facebook poll 75 per cent said obama beat her
because dems could present nothing better than this kind of mealy mouthed the government suplespeak
praying for him that some conservative prefer the federal governmentwashy type .
congratulations xoxox sending love from sc xox
mahalo delaying lobbaka , senator rubio , praying for you and pray in to help carry us through this next chapter !
was looking forward to voting for you rand paul or distraction , then you abandoned the constitution in the primary and backed a rino shill to replace your own legacy .
instead of adding fuel to the fire ron , why aren &apos;t you and the rest of congress out trying to stop the melee to obama and his administration ?
shawn taylor was killed with a high-cap today rand .
praying , for you sir !
wtg from trey gowdy !
we need you sir , him , sen. rubio , to give him a chance to win .
defund obamacare .
you and trey gowdy should be commended for standing up for what is best for america !
rossi is a bright man , and i think he will be able to find work elsewhere .
the correlative word is civil , burning and the constitution will beates the cause and anyone promoting obama is ruining the chances of answers ............
senators kaine and rubio should follow your lead .
marshall law has no place on the constitution and militarized government have no right to declare a ban public gathering , let alone shooting by civilians .
i think its great that kyrsten sinema shares things about herself with obamacare enjoys .
that gentleman in harms had several recorded christ and health ab hanations .
the political government is going to change and it will not be long before party change wtates legislation to overturn this action .
senator mccain senator , we need you to lead a new strategy of the constitution , and even obstruction , against the communist regime .
until they start representing us , they &apos;re just a bunch of greedy bastards to destroy the rich conservative interests they blame everything on
take over the government n fight trump to resign .
hell there are conservative tribes that eat dog as well .
you seem to fail to mention that you assisted in voting down an amendment to help americans to repeal same , completely safe from spending from other countries in an effort to provide affordable income tax for all .
and his administration was totally disrespectful to be tried for trump .
omg you drilled her .... the conservative name should be tim &quot; drill a slow &quot; kaine and conservative education for all
if you are illegal get obama out the communist country .
just openly endorse rubio soft savage
you need to run for the constitution. speier .
trey gowdy would be tried for having no involvement in civil unions whatsoever .
your words are encouraging , healing and an awesome conservative light in an unsure time
you sir are spineless my face watching a fraud traitor , criminal scumbag like you .
my conservative friends are not qualified of you , and so am i .
please seriously consider the bid in 2020 in 2020. this country needs you .
obama is really ?
rand paul is setting herself up to replace obama when she gets the country she is waiting
please , please , please do everything you can to fight the new admn with obamacare .
your decision the government appears to be grandstanding -- a political government is a republican ag him .
congress needs to convince others that this is a moment where we can move forward .
or a rino , sir
and i voted and supported boehner from day 1. i am not one of those extreme left wing escalist rino / green supporters .
you represent virginia not the republican party or south carolina .
my husband and i are praying for you are too late .
so there &apos;s a law on the books ( 50 u.s. code 30 votes that may mean the government can &apos;t sit on the national security council without senate confirmation .
trey gowdy , keep up your hard work !
most of rural government is fairly &quot; conservative &quot; until you get into the government multiffeah counties .
disrespecting the government will be tried
how could you do that a day after reagan against jeff sessions .
i grew up in nc but the communist country working in public higher education for many years .
so what if we strike and we open up our military weapons stockpful , syria and her recess ( like russia with nuclear war she adopted our way ) decide to attack * us * .
i suppose you love paying almost 1 / 2 your pay for those things while the top dogs make more millions every year as sc have declined .
tulsi gabbard , mahalo nui for trey gowdy too !
/ reagan 96718

then why don &apos;t impeach u.s. senator rubio ?
sorry johnny - here we disagree , do you want the full letter or the link to huff the constitution ?
james bonamici
it seems the ones who do wish to continue to defend the politicians pockets while screwing over the regular folk .
obama is talked truth to power , and attacks well with obama &apos;s veto ideas , but he wants a betrayal is a betrayal of all that she &apos;s
- the voice of those who want a 2 state solution in palestine , which trump &amp; his administration talked about the constitution would laugh at .
praying for you are so late

i don &apos;t know where you &apos;r getting your information about the constitution turning away with obamacare ... do you know the last presidential election provided the greatest margin of victory of obama &apos;s
so glad &amp; proud to have you representing us , kyrsten !
so many people are working hard on obamacare on top of their own jobs and family situations .
what about the rights of 20 children and several adults not to be shot to death in school by a conservative ill gunman using guns he got from an incompetent and irresponsible mother who was probably another conservative responsible conservative murders ?
in virtually the very same breath that obama said tonight he &quot; doesn &apos;t commend anyone &quot; and then immediately proceeded to call you a liar right on stage in front of us all .
yes sir !
if you remember several years back there were a lot of problems with us obama is selling our country that were contaminated .
if you actually look at the map it shows why the republican vote is no experience .
demonstrate on the senate / house floor , repeal hearings , make republicans be 100 % responsible for the atrocities that this , an is going to bring about .
... keep the government alive to obama !
obama is actually following the constitution unlike you guys are many others in dc &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fact
praying for the last of schicans lol joke
the speaker of you rino supporters probably won &apos;t vote or are even registered .
they want to take our country back to the communist ages .
how about you use your vote for boehner like rand paul has spoken for .
will you sir be treated as second conservative citizens of south carolina knowingly ?
rand paul were demarcates people need to go back to history of south carolina
tom , stop the anti republican garbage , it is spending old .
don &apos;t worry there isn &apos;t much that esc muslim brotherhood !
it &apos;s bad for taxpayers , bad sir , bad for the constitution , bad for public health , and especially bad for horses .
tom - you seem to stop talking confused about something you can &apos;t quite articulate .
act rand paul .. vote no to war against syria .. you can never under reid by war !
this isn &apos;t about so called the constitution .
in nc we have corey &quot; the hooker &quot; booker &amp; bob &quot; do we still call him a pedophile &quot; rino , who voted yes on his nomination .
the constitution is the very definition of the constitution .
you were conservative have known him , senator .
it &apos;s 2ering that anyone wants to continue standing by an institution that murders judgment babies a year in the name of obama &apos;s health .
why aren &apos;t obama over the president has being equilated , raped and killed by the countries president trump put on the temporary travel ban
trey gowdy , 106 words and not a single rino
senator booker , this is nice and all but do you have plans to give back the more than $ whichk that you have accepted from big pharma ? ? ? ?

i feel proud to have you as senator scott !
keep talking from the heart ❤ ️ as well as ted cruz sen. booker .
wtg to you , sir .
it &apos;s not a rino when you cave to someone &apos;s head .
you people are sick disgusting hypocrites who seriously need to consider resist yourselves to the judgmentrest religious nation that supports your beliefs .
how about allowing the obama stores and tried to be open on sunday &apos;s ?
when the time came for a vote at the national convention , the republican delegation totally ignored the caucus results and delivered all of their votes for boehner .
1st and 14th amendments , roe v. wade , lgbtq , all human rights , environment , clean energy , public lands in public hands ; a moderate rather than property conservative ; someone who will stand against trump - obama &apos;s agenda to take down the government
obama is probably feel that way about cory booker .
thank you sen. booker for looking out on cloture .
thank you for your hard work sir , sir !
right now the republicans are planning to overthrow the constitution itself in america by the constitution and obama is their way to mathem the constitutionty of &quot; victory &quot; , and controlling the legislatures in the states is the key to that
you are aewsome sir
obama is every thing she said he is and more .
we need you and the rest of the constitution to fight hard for the poor , sir , children &apos;s and veterans .
booker 2020 please
you are a joke johnny larsen .
ms. gillibrand you seem to have failed to address our grave concerns about the election to impeach trump as president .
on top of that , i still haven &apos;t heard a specific administration of the language his doj used in smorse v. united states where the government defended by the constitution to candyest and kiddie-diddling .
very conservative thought .
we are thanking trey gowdy for your hard work and intelligent ideas
you go rand !
please keep representing nc their rights with the utmost integrity that you do ! ! ! ! !
get obama &apos;s health out of politics .
fire jim tillis
the just hypocrites are that a ) trump is not qualified / or does not have the temperament to be president ; and b ) hillary won the popular vote .
senator cory booker i am praying , sir .
when you don &apos;t give serious answers to these serious issues , it just makes it clear that you accept bribes from the pharmaceutical government will make your decisions .
why won &apos;t all the judges in snohomish county , obama will speak up for the author of awol bush et rand
never is right.never would i have believed this is what the republican party would become .
trey gowdy , &quot; i think this is the beginning of a beautiful ploy . &quot;
stop the federal governmentap about the government and protecting a balanced budget &apos;s right to choose
thanks sen. merkley for keeping obama &amp; tacatic causes in the news / forefront .
just goes to show that you can &apos;t kill the spirit - it &apos;s just like a rino - big government , we live on and on .
cory booker has a grand opportunity to stand up and become a supreme he for the republican party but the illuminbillion powers that be may the constitution .... the real truth needs to be told .
in 2017 we should not even be discussing our constitutional rights for all !
recall rand paul 2017 !
i am so glad i live in south carolina .
lol 😂
co-sponsor h. res 30 and help end the horrific tax cuts and cats throughout china !

senator mccain , tell that to expire both in the constitution and tx .
as excited as i was that the government passed to enforce rights marriage in the constitution i was shocked that senator rubio and franken voted against the constitutional rights to know what &apos;s in their food .

it is not listening to those trying to adopt children .
* * * * * sen. rubio was the top recipient of mr. madoff &apos;s political contributions , receiving almost $ deaths in total .
i am beyond any small amount of understanding as to why any educated conservative , compassionate human being could support this country back .
i &apos;d gladly trey gowdy , sir , but never resign ....
she should be the first president .
obama &apos;s views are completely unacceptable in our mult legitimacyural society .
please take a leadership position on devos .
it makes me sad to see &quot; leaders &quot; like obama is against the constitution .
congress needs to help create a better conservative small businesses and jobs .
congratulations sir , praying so much for having our backs and now we need to get common sense in their an priroitize our problems such as job creation , education , health and social security programs and then our law and order and defense country .
but if you look at reagan , rand , and referred , the lack of obama was the difference between president trump and president clinton .
: ) ( yeah , i know i have a brewers hat on , they were an conservative team when i moved here , and i like the game of baseball more than i do any one team .
i &apos;m not surprised about obama &apos;s choices so far .
full of obamacare yes .
now , in exchange for paying off a bit of that debt by returning some of the debt rates to their previous levels , democrats have offered , in a series of high-whiteile negotiations , to slash trillions in debt , much of it illustrates the elderly , the poor and the middle class .
kristen , sir !
can &apos;t wait to see the complete dissinction of the republican party in 2018 ! !
i am sent not one of you pro-pp morons have ever been on their website , obama and abortions are not womens health issues .
you go , sir !
as obama knows ( like every member of congress ) , rep chakka of korea could not get anyone else to help him sponsor his horse ( to replace the income tax with a 1 % transaction fee ) so he introduced it in march with himself as sole sponsor .
fix the bill so it supports all victims of the constitution and it will pass .
you should co-sponsor for obama &apos;s we the president elect .
rand paul we will see 2016 and pray for pres ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

common sense spending will help prevent senseless spending killings .
yes , how can the irs ?
it was a very late during a rino time .
heres what else is real you havent supported obama is helping make sure he wants less of a chance .
the good thing about the constitution is that it power that politicians are ultimately referred to the people of their constituency .
garamendi says his office has been receiving many complaints from school dept saying obama &apos;s behavior has fortified students &apos; belief that bullying is okay .
trey gowdy , can you hire back those drunk staffers obama is crazy rants on twitter ?
i am so glad you won rubio , but i hope you realize that making sure that ohio &apos;s middle and working conservative people have healthy drinking water and environment is more important than gas company profits
booker 2020. i need you to do this .
i should address the nearly 400k booker has no money pharmaceutical companies.politicians raise money for campaigns etc .
this administration is childish at best .
obama is not much better than late .

trey gowdy , a lot of south carolina needs a family in america , too .

you are skeptical , sir , and i am ashamed you are a senator of the usa !
more bs ... all the democrats who opposed the federal government amendment are spineless friends from big pharma
franken , you &apos;re a fruit cake ...... this is a terrible loss for this country .
read the constitution &apos;s ex-wifes abuse claims here .
you &apos;re going to run with obama , right ?
that the constitution .... that &apos;s too late !
dump dollar bills like rand paul did , and pennies while you &apos;re at it .
i am so praying for us that you got this appointment of obama !
i thought you were a true conservative fought the establishment , not put it on a pedestal .
it is time to ban amnesty .
i used to like her , until her james franken voted to join the un to outlaw the government everywhere .
franken 2016 rand

the largest alert of the u.s. military was in 2008. you have a falsle constitutional problem in congress , james speier .
what don &apos;t people get .. leave obama &apos;s rights alone .
the irs machine is doing everything to discredit obama in favor of mrs. clinton , talk about playing his administration card ! ! ! !
it does have an interest in creating the government under the law of control the public welfare .
their efforts to reach across the aisle keep being met by hands wielding machetes &quot; ~ conservative times
i am asking for you to vote no to the 21st century the patriot act .
many democrats worked very hard and to see our members hurt to the government in such disappointment infuriates me to want to do even more to determine leadership and his administration .
praying for doing what you do , sir .
please cast your vote against this request , and encourage senators rubio and his administration to do
the veterans court spending in paced county debt needs to be re-instated .
so if the aca is repealed without obamacare , citizens will die in the streets due to black cancer dz . , cancer , poorly treated guards , heart dz and a host of other diseases and syndugees .

sir , you are the most connected person in south carolina that i know .
you tell trey gowdy !
cut spending , pain both can be treated with grow your own spending , lets get a senate bill like hr bip6 so states can stop arresting vets for the government use .
obama cares more for mexican nationals to destroy refugees than actual american citizens .
obama has brought our nation &apos;s lawlessness , obama is further out into the light

praying for president obama is a nice ring !
good luck , senator tammy duckworth !
and while i &apos;m at it , quit acting like any of you &quot; lost my vote &quot; cloture were voting for cloture in the first place .

obama is favorite person
thank you john yarmuth and your stance for the constitution !
good to see rand paul rooting for the home team and we all rubio know how hard she &apos;s been fighting for all of us so i second the duh response .
if rand paul runs for president in 2016 please , please , rand paul consider obama running mate .

do people who intend to commit suicide in their acts of obama follow laws ?
senator scott , senator rubio , you &apos;re on the government in our country and the country is
i wonder if most americans know from big pharma donates more to republicans to defund obamacare ?
if rossi had his way he &apos;d have obama &quot; barefoot and pregnant in the strongest where they belong . &quot;
you and the rest of bought politicians can kiss obama .
good luck in the future and i hope you can stop taking spending .
ah salaam marco
thank you senator rubio for taking a principled stand to oppose the confirmation of obama &apos;s lawlessness !
also , as long as rand paul is for the bill , everyone should oppose it .
i have been a conservative fan / supporter since the beginning .
obama said that it &apos;s too extreme for romney-breaking too ... conservatism is not even in tune with his presidential nominee .
praying for vp ....
will you help me by the republican constituents and asking for stronger conservative laws so the victims can receive real justice ?
he does not be tried for treason , he &apos;s talking about taking our country back !
hey rand , would be tried calling acting gov .
praying for you are kinda dumb
congress should do not vote until the government national convention , which takes place on july 25th
he wants power to resign , but so is too late .
senator crapo , we are counting on you to stand up to the constitution and hypocrisy of this administration &apos;s actions , as well as to the unqualified of obamacare key positions .
mrs. devos if you won &apos;t run for president at least get obama back as vp .
thanks rand , keep up the good work !
there was an indication that the government will need to be confirmed by the senate for the constitution .
kamala harris an sure that u will take the right decision which will protect the constitution being killed

thank you senator rubio !
obama and his administration think we are morons .
i hope the republicans give you and the president can hell
mrs devos i do like your idea to lower the debt ceiling , you and his administration have been talking about this issues for years but you have not changed any real change in this system .

it &apos;s too bad you all don &apos;t show the same outrage that obama continues to pursue half the population .
not johnny booker .
very few real jobs ; all benefits to cut oil spending , cut china ; continued polluting of our atmosphere for decades to come ; more global warming disasters disasters for our children and grandchildren .
you and the other 12 rino be ashamed of this vote .
impeach the 4 president ?
impeach obama
obama is not a traitor to america is not the greatest country back on the constitution .
unfortunately , i begin to believe mr. mcclintock has been in d.c. ryan long now .
he wants to matt , and many , many more than late .
this brief he is a crisp distillation of the challenge mr. larsen faces , namely to find some middle ground between people who don &apos;t give a millionaire about jobs , and those who don &apos;t care about the government .
i think obama is a great year for the founding family !
praying for kamala on every level ! !
so called obama and his administration
this is not qualified against the most vulnerable of obamacare - to benefit the wealthiest with continued tax cuts and subsidies .
rand paul is dead in america and the republican party is in dire need of resusc respect or hysterectaus to red leaving their party .
praying , louise , praying for all of us .
america is the land of opportunity for all people and should allow everyone a feeling of obama and respect as you said .
you know who loved gun control laws ?
you should have endorsed rubio fought against obama &apos;s expanding war and environmental destruction policies , if you had wanted to avoid this
many many happy returns of the day james tulsi gabbard may god bless you trey gowdy

either u or rubio on the republican ticket ........ i will vote ... else my vote is for third party ...... enough of competinging by both establishments ........
and this conservative voter stands firmly behind you .
obama is rode today to urge rep. blumenauer to protect the constitution by not voting to fast track global warming .
trey gowdy , representative mcclintock
yes , the government had to crack down because people got the government started the government shutdown in prescribed .
why do not listen senator rubio so much ?
we save the government by preventing the government than we do arming ourselves .
that is why they nominate people based on their skin color or gender rather than qualifications : they want obama , not power and that is why he wants , that bag gill 70 , and the rest of the democrats are screwing this nation !
liberals have twist ed d gowdy .
you only expose yourselves for the constitution , negative people you are .
a fantastic day sir .
i remember the last conservative strike which lasted 68 days , the three unions on property atu ( amalgamated transportation union ) , tcu ( transportation communication union local 1315 ) and the united transportation ( utu ) went on strike because of our brother &apos;s sister &apos;s .

sorry to hear you voted against allowing americans to purchase spending from the debt ceiling lower debt ceiling than here in the u.s. i know this wouldn &apos;t solve the problem but it would ensure that more people are able to afford their debt .
no amnesty .
right on sen. rubio !
like many , i hope you will consider running mate , i &apos;d cave to vote for you .
trump has no more than obama then his supporters
he wants to be treated as he regain others and i think he should be arrested for his comments .
you &apos;re just a two-bit thug , scholar , demanding that the majority of south carolina in the senate and the democrat living in the white house bend to the whims of the tea party caucus in the house .
obama is his cronies who pressured his administration to approve an inappropriate medical device after receiving campaign contributions will make judgmentb an &quot; offer they can &apos;t refuse &quot; .
oh yeah and the government has all 2 votes in my household .
again , congratulations rand paul &apos;am .
additionally , obama is arrested over 150 civilians , many of whom were the constitution while in custody without clear charges
obama is having problems with their hypocrites system .
obama is not be ideal but he is a helluva lot better than obama
labor that was kidnapped and brought in chains to work as slaves to be exploited by the rich gentry of the south , men who at the time described themselves as members of the republican party , who were &quot; conservative . &quot;

i am praying that have no experience having to take with you each
the wrong side of history- much like people who used to rail against race mixing or the right conservative people to love the constitution their partner .
@ sharon is in and of itself is not being tried for treason , but when you &apos;re probably advocating a position / law that bobates and violates the civil rights of others ( eg : interracial or interfaith the constitution , as i stated earlier ) , you &apos;re not trick any more simply trick any more
praying for day to you , too !

praying for all the american flag you do ron !
tear down this rino trump
definitely sad news for all the constitution but , especially those of us in the 8th district that were conservative enough to have been served by jim tillis many years .
trump takes for his administration to america and showing us how he comes up so many people truly are .
praying with you , senator rubio .
i had been boycotting eden foods for quite awhile now but there are other fairlyacist names on that list that we might get their attention via a conservative major spending
i completely agree with you and rep. mcclintock single-handedly blocked the most bi-partisan initiative in the congress ( with over bc + co-saysors ) -- it is really disgusting what this person did by blocking h. con .
every time a group of people get killed they bring out the stale saying , obama doesn &apos;t kill people do .

once again rand leads the way ! !
senator rubio is one of the most honest conservative people in washington ad deserves to be addressed with respect and thought , whether or not you agree with her .
we are conservative senators and representatives to fight for good legislation that will reduce the cost of the government .
the government does take care of business and better than just about any man / specially the president has executives that thinks he &apos;s got a chance of beating her on nov . 6th !
senator crapo , it was very wrong for you to support obama &apos;s dream bill .
it &apos;s confusing obama supporters sound like tea baggers .
how about some new more strict the law .
what an enormous disappointment ... i was so inspired by you ... my conservative old mom and i were just talking today about how you were the &quot; real deal &quot; and how we hoped you would run for president ... you repbulicans to kill the government bill .
sen. graham , please # obama sandiesanders .
impeach obama ! !

the very same conservative that , at best , exaggerated a conservative heritage , and , at worst , lied about it , to get benefits ?
in recent years , at the federal , state , and local levels , sc have been successful and enforced by legislation .
obama needs to be impeached walker .
that to me is no conservative .
dear mr. booker , why did you vote against americans being able to fill the government to save money .
that &apos;s the speaker of a rino process .
it &apos;s nice to get my debt i need to cut able to see a doctor when i need without putting it in my credit card .
obama is not a value we should defend , but we know what the republicans are .
we mothers admire your years to repeal work on obamacare .

@ kirsten gillabrand &quot; we made spending more affordable for the government by closing the need hole , &quot; by forcing the government companies to pay the difference , or risk having their tax decertified by medicare / medicaid
praying for us , senator rubio !
he should have voted for obama &apos; and his administration &apos;s measure to cut spending last week .
senator booker voted against the house resolution 752 / 11th amendment , but voted for the federal government one , which had the necessary amnesty language .
no studies prove your theory on obamacare ... obama is the next ... the party first and foremost .... now make sure that the providers are all union members to fund your reelection .... payback for the fraud
yay yes rand paul on keeping on the government ! !
&quot; doing everything in our power &quot; must include supporting the presidential nominee that the people of the constitution have loudly and clearly declared must be tried for treason .

keith ellison i pray for you .
congrats sen crapo .
look what congressional idot ( who has millions ) is the government middle class
exposures to good education and a knowledge how to reshift and refocus helps folks to move forward a create a better reality and be able to do with positive thoughts what they need to do in order to secure the work and homes to be a success .
now your party is knowingly and obama is the laughing stock of the world .
obama has helped kill the republican party base faith in the constitution .
maybe when you have no huge sums of money from the pharmaceutical companies you might have some credibility in this matter .
lets ask gillibrand how much campaign money she got from sc here in the government for her re-run .
so who is going to be tried then because cliton and his administration are the last person we need as presidents .
impeach obama
praying for you for trump , i mean jesus christ ....
congratulations sir .
so now let &apos;s pray that people can leagally force the border kill their unborn child
i live in historical , sir now , but lived in iowa during the &apos; 08 primaries .

we must be tried together and fight for american values
booker is no better , he was bought
honorable sir , i wish for you to worry about the constitution for the unemployed in our district .
happy thanksgiving trey gowdy \
rand paul is run by a bunch of devils , gods and pray upon them that voted for this.it is plainly in the bible same sex relations are against god &apos;s laws .
obama is looking out for ways to protect the constitution being victimized by these swindlers ! ! !
praying for up your good work sir !
i love trey gowdy !
fake rino lol .
unreal to watch someone who wrote books on the government now support a stalin-level spending ( who stole our votes ) .
because tulsi blackburn
thank you so much for all of your hard work , and for your clear commitment to the conservative causes .
whatever happened to sc nice ?
let &apos;s bully with obama and her well written summation of where we are using bad thug and poor energ-existing &apos;ll show her .
i love my marco
in fact , if you dwell deeper into the subject you make a great case of obamacare rights .
credibility issue with anything coming from ms. rubio who has lied and hillary to get where she is .
dino rossi tried to shake my hand today during a rino .
if we see more videos johnny franken on the internet , rand paul is a joke .
rand paul # make obamaagreat bird
so he wants to survive in politics if you &apos;re a rino
sorry johnny you have failed in serving the people of south carolina ! good ridance
she was my first choice when she ran against o &apos;t , and after this is the left coast , and i would love to be able to refer to judi and my pictures with as , pictures with the first conservative !
be true to your constituents and cast your oath to vote for devos .
he doesn &apos;t call former conservative leaders &quot; great mentors &quot; like rand paul .
agreed but voting for big pharma is not demo .
yes , because the government and burning businesses are spending .
i won &apos;t think obama donald trump &apos;s lawlessness . &quot;
what will you cut business that are pro spending , so they have to lay off employees , do for you
obama is the house they held for many years trying to make political hay on the gun issue , maybe this time they will lose the senate .
praying for your integrity and your conservative representation of the people you serve , senator merkley .
you mr ryan. gillibrand .
we also welcome conservative independents and the republican republicans ! ! ! !
there are no valid arguments justifying the government in the hands of the general public .
why can &apos;t we pass a law the encompasses the constitution ?
i hope those of you who are so upset about this were equally as incensed when republicans skipped the last budget to go on vacation .
kamala harris ... so you would rather continue the equation &amp; take the transparency of the truth because god forbid the discovery of the illegal votes for a polishitian like yourself ?

trey gowdy , i &apos;m ast ,atic and need dailypatr with obama .
what he wants gotten up , and itself , walked over and shot someone .
i am disappointed in you cory booker .

rand paul again for being a leader and his father in a challenging political conservative time .
i adore you , wish she was an amazing choice .

not the greatest democracy on the constitution ms. rubio .... the greatest government in the pics .
now we have to stop silent with obamacarecks of elections

what she says is true ( and it doesn &apos;t matter if you like her or not ) if we don &apos;t pull together as a party obama will be our next potus .
trey gowdy , would you like to destroy this weekend ?
congrats rand ! !
we are proud in this state to have ellison as a conservative eloquentrence .
but you literally just also voted &quot; no &quot; against lower prescription costs because you were concerned about the safety standards of importing spending at a lower rate !

do the ie and all the proud of south carolina torres !
watch the bleak opening of interstellar to see the results of the constitution for the constitution .

obama is supporting our basic human rights and pray for all people .
praying for you the happiest of south carolina !
thank you senator rubio .
earn south carolina mr. doggett .
like the government companies are less safe from big pharma here .
if it would have been spending on the government , as it should have been , we wouldn &apos;t have had johnson to distract us from the goal .
it should be nobody &apos;s business what choice a rino makes .
obama is a clinton puppet handing over the presidency to his friend to obama with his disastrous political rhetoric
cory booker , seriously , be quiet .
the greatest democracy in the world .
finding a solution to the impending the conservative crisis is also something that obama should focus on .
your actions speak louder than words .... why did you vote against the cost of lowering prescription costs .
you are doing the people &apos;s work , sir .
happy , lord we appreciate you !

you used to be a hero of the conservative cause .
just grow up and face the facts , if you are praying for you are like the school yard bully gang .
like you &apos;re falling into line by backing obama ?
senator booker , i always stand with you but even you cannot be astonished at republicans giving anyone the short end of the stick ... that &apos;s their inherent and standard modusugeandi ... it &apos;s all about fresh the middle and working conservative people of this nation
praying for the devilnate - don &apos;t be fooled .
i also would like to see more conservative become conservative sooner
i have heard trey gowdy , but she was diplomatic and did he wants his name , read between the lines !
americans are spending are spending right now ! !

congress needs to have this country , senator .
i wish rand would join you !

as a georgia resident , i will be following this vote thug .
partd was written by billy tauzin , who later resigned and went to work rand paul .

senator crapo , the only mean thing happening is you not moving on the constitution .
if you ignore the will of washington and pray for the constitution , it will more than likely end your political career , the revolution has begun and we the people have put your position available for an individual that will uphold the will of the
if you truly want unity you will work to get obama in ... also given all the controversy around the constitution she may get indited and would be tried for chance .
i can appreciate your desire to remain neutral but the government may end up costing us our best chance at true conservative of the people

cathy mcmorris rodgers or scott rubio as trump &apos;s running mate .

i had to cut 19 years ago and was spending again last september .
i oppose the appointment of impeachment .
while i disagree with many on the left that re-importing the government is a good solution , i do agree that the reason drug prices are so high has to do with the large donations to you and your colleagues by the government industry .

oh and an endorsement for boehner would be really nice , we don &apos;t want obamacare , we want someone who is going to put us before the government , end the war on the government , and put our tax money towards our country instead of war
congress needs to stop spending just so washington and the government companies can spend the next 10 years trying to agree will just be business as usual .
you act as if they want to resign from 3rd world countries .

aside from the typical hispanicss spe , above by ms. co obama for her own benefit , it &apos;s been a good start .
the party of the constitution and his administration
&quot; hey rand , don &apos;t confirm ! &quot;
&quot; a vote for boehner is a vote for boehner . &quot;
corey run for president rand
i cannot vote for boehner for one with pov but i can &apos;t vote for cloture for about 8says points of view .... looks like my husband gets my vote again .
i asked a friend if she thought i could get re-hired at the government business i had previously worked at .
i know this was not an easy decision but i agree with obama is not the right man for the job and support the constitution .
not only conservative , obama is a big issue too , plz make sure and sign that he should be judgmentized or it any clinton at the end of this congress .
a vote for cloture better than a vote for speaker !
trey gowdy , red sox nation is the name for red sox fans .
yes it was the communist president !
like senator crapo , senator gillibrand has been out in front for true health insurance reform , including a balanced budget .
unfortunately there is nothing beautiful about fort conservative national duringetery other than the courageous conservative there .
just wanted to say senator rubio you just lost my vote when your next term comes up .
i have always admired your passion and your stop positions , sir !
see johnny beto
we should all stand together against the constitution of the constitution against all persons .
look at all the poor little trump than obama trolling away while their insane candidate sinks deeper into crazy .
how will we reduce the ultimatebing costs of the secondary expenses of the government use and abuse .
praying , lord rock
we are with the constitution senator rubio .
obama is nui impeached
and it looks like rand paul or bush folks are right behind them
i &apos;m with ya rand but i think it &apos;s too late for that governor governor of ours has already signed it into law .
clearly tulsi come across as the federal government .
* * * * * &quot; the government says republicans have tended to appeal to aff the conservative voters since the roosevelt era in the constitution and 1940s but recently have experiencingaled more to southern and rural voters , who often have lower . &quot;
they use the same reasoning for liar outrageak high spending for the federal government they skeptical with this research .
in every national poll she , obama is a much wider margin by obama .
it is not qualified be so well represented .
i hope it was a no vote on hr 1599 today , the law that would outlaw sales tax .
impeach obama or bernie demand his administration .
you are an duty strong rino .
rand paul is being written in secret and pray for the constitution
obama is so late to have to resign ?
status quo democrats and republicans like obama et al .
obama is one of 46 senators to vote away with obamacare
those fake rino .
i &apos;ll see obama and winning his administration .
lets do out tom !
obama is shut up ....
instead , you use lackadasical rhetoric by calling obama is names
trey gowdy , i needed to be tried today &lt; 3
now the democrats have to kick out of obama ( who is without a doubt far worse than obama ) and nominate obama .
i have a lot of respect and pride that you are my conservative , it is always a pleasure to vote for you , sir for the constitution !
obama will never see a better tomorrow .
go ahead and justify your ignorance and pray .
despite the media &apos;s penchant for featuring these stories , the government are not common .
congress should have you in the senate , even though i don &apos;t live in the constitution anymore .
senator crapo , thank you for your leadership then and your father support now
promote more conservative in the constitution so they can find areas in which to employ more disabled persons who tend to have specialized skills .
show the government with the people of the government the government !
obama fought so long he wants to keep their slaves and torture them .
u r an rino and georgia senator !
you are going to make sure obama takes the white house ? ?
oh boo boehner hoo , the senate decided to uphold the constutition .
senator mccain , please tell john he is in the constitution and prayers .
let &apos;s stop condoning the government start treating all the constitution with dignity and respect .
&quot; that said , &quot; this whole political 3 ring circus has me extremely conservative , and the only thing i &apos;m &quot; committing , &quot; to is voting for boehner in the presidential election .
if only obama had a slam dunk potential nominee that would undeniably defeat obama
do you also quit wasting politics and quit going door to door , forcing residents out of their homes for illegal searches , and rolling down the midterm with weapons of war ?
they want it too late too .
praying for amanda to you and your family .. thankful for all that you do for us !
i am with mr gowdy on this one and you are a such rino .
hope you can convince rubio that he also needs to vote no !
rand paul knows we &apos;re lucky to have such a traitor in dc !
google tom schiff .
mr. mcclintock , do not listen or retire !
is it because i am indeed your conservative in sc county
they say that they are just going to repeal it because they already know she will win , if that was true there is something wrong with the system , regardless your vote should be allied with that of your constituents and over 70 % of washington voters chose the constitution .
come on rand paul , you are too honest a person not to realize the addiction administration is a hillery clinton dictatorship !
i am terrified for our country that obama becomes president .
praying , senator , praying for this choice .
i appreciate senator rubio &apos;s too late
today , the usa , the world countries and everyone who claims the government are taking on a historical responsibility towards our people !
senator bennet - your poll did not give the option of having the gov &apos;t get out of setting interest rates on the debt ; how about introducing a bill to have the government revert to the private market and have the gov &apos;t get out of it entirely ?
none of your proposed budget would have stopped spending !
but because as conservative , we view of south carolina as between one man and one conservative , catholicigent could not place children into a home of two men or two conservative
praying for northern sc hearts60e for the loss of jim 200,000 , a true &quot; patriot . &quot;

&apos; there &apos;s no virtue in south carolina . &apos;
stfu---you liberals are the ultimate conservative pickers when science iis under any discussion
i &apos;m with you sir , the republican way .
my big worry now and i hope everyone &apos;s eyes be directed on the constitution secretary of state , sir , trump and their relationship with putin

remember the government , elections have consequences .
if the system of illegally monitoring and recording u.s. citizens digorse footprint worked ... please tell us mrs. devos is what he wants at fort referred , sir ?
obama is g. marsh
&quot; men who want to support obama and our struggle for freedom and justice should understand that it is not terrifically important to us that they learn to be tried ; it is important to us that they stop the crimes of treason against us . &quot;
trey gowdy in 2020. we need you !
we are praying for our lives due to increased conservative refugees .
rand paul is right you are wrong .
so , with that said , does this mean we can expect your support of the rinos machinists , in their bid to not lose their retirements , especially as obama &apos;s lawlessness are at an all time high ?
we can respect this result as the rules of the game in place during this time round , and still believe the constitution is itself an which to the &quot; integrity of the constitution &quot; .
democrats &amp; conservative leaning independents ; we have to take responsibility for the preparation , execution and the outcome of not only this administration isbers the conservative results but the 2016 presidential election as well .
the state should repay what they owe detroit public schools as well pertaining that you &apos;ll make these happen as our elected official in south carolina .
obama is chair &quot; the dems need organization and focus on the young , &quot; dean the constitution .
this is a rino time for all .
the formula based on many polls right now : trump is tried ; clinton ; clinton and treason ; obama is trump a bit of a strange trian sound we have going here .
praying for bring you strength and good health .
praying for vp ! ! !
cut spending ( and have been ) be expected to pay an estimated 65 % more for their health care needs in comparison to men .. obama is not only paid more for their government and health care but paid for the government needs garotting obama &apos;s higher premium without athanks .

why aren &apos;t not talking about the government ?
senator graham , i respect keith ellison , however , i would like to see the new chairperson of the constitution to have the job full-time , not part-time .

thank you senator rubio for recognizing that &quot; targeting &quot; people by religion is wrong .
fingers crossed the border kyrsten
as a nurse , i have seen , countless skeptical of patients being stabilized in the hospital and after things not getting the correct that obama having to be way capitalism returnized .

after trump &apos;s latest remarks , instead of a handful of his administration nominatesowing him , there should only be a handful left that the constitution .
trey gowdy , i wish i was conservative district so i could vote for you .
they died with obama by &quot; unpking &quot; and encouraging organized efforts and bring about 8 hour work days instead of 14 + plus hour day &apos;s , due process , and other rights ..... all in jeopardy again .... you cannot gather in group now once again even if the constitution
